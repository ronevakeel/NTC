Fürst Bismarck  on Thursday, Nov. 17th bound for Naples, - Mr. and Mrs. Davis - Nettie Buttles - with Howard Amory - and the faithful Jones.  We had brilliant weather and smooth sea, with the exception of one day and night when we rolled tremendously.  The ship [sic; is] admirable.  It was her first voyage in these southern waters.  We had only about 120 first class passengers in all that big ship - but a most noisy and unattractive lot.  The only ones we could fraternize with were Mrs. and Miss Bronson of New York - and Mrs. Ledyard of Newport, with her daughter Mrs. Spencer Ledyard formerly Mrs. Fred Newbold.  We carried over 900 steerage passengers - all Italians - going back, most of them to spend the winter in Italy.  Nettie who has been very ill, and hardly able to sit up when first brought on board, improved with every moment, was never ill, and beamed with pleasure the whole day.  The Bismarck has a hurricane deck forward - a most delightful nest among the smoke stacks and great ventilators - and we had it generally quite to ourselves.  Reached Gibraltar on the morning of the 25th Friday, at 7 o’clock - and we were up, Nettie and I, to see the approach to the great Rock, which was beautiful in that early dawn, with a mass of rose coloured cloud about its head - the blue water crisp with the fresh breeze, and the many little boats that put out to us gay with their colours and cargoes             Page 2of fruit and flowers.  Dropped our anchor for 2 hours, and sent three passengers ashore - and Howard went ashore with Mrs. Spencer Ledyard and a young British diplomat, who had come out to meet her.  Then we had again lovely weather and smooth sailing to Genoa, where we reached the dock on Sunday morning at 7:30.  A cold bitter wind was blowing - the first touch of anything like winter we have had.  Here Mrs. Bronson and her daughter left us, going to Florence for the winter.  In a few hours we were off again for Naples, and on 12 o’clock on Monday 29, were at anchor in the bay, with Vesuvius just before us - looking more splendid and dignified in his unbroken sloping lines than I had ever seen him, with just a suspicion of smoke at his summit.  It was beautiful entering that unrivalled bay in that big steamer and from the vantage ground of the hurricane deck - and it was touching to see the delight of our Italians as they recognized first one and then another familiar thing.  We went to the Grand Hotel for the night, and were off the next afternoon at 4 o’clock on the Hydaspes - one of the small P. & O. steamers, for Alexandria.  It was cold in Naples, so that fires were necessary in our rooms - it was still colder on the water, and the walls of the ship were ventilated in the manner of eastern steamships, so that it was impossible to avoid draughts, and of course I promptly took cold.  The decks were very pleasant - and what a delightful exchange in the way of fellow passengers, from those of the Bismarck.  One of my neighbors at table was very interesting - a Mr. Tylor - going out to Egypt to excavate at El Kab - had been a great deal in America - and was very jolly - but with a heavy Page 3cold - and a suggestive cough.  Reached Alexandria at 7 o’clock on Saturday Dec.  3.  Nettie and Howard all eyes for the strange people and their ways.  We lunched at the Khedival, having of course been detained too long at the Custom House to catch the 9 o’clock train to Cairo - where we did not arrive until 8:30 in the evening.  As the train pulled in the station I recognized our dear Mahommed Salah waiting for us, with our old cook Hanna Ibraim - and they gave us warmest greetings.  We came to Shepheards, which has been greatly enlarged and improved since we were here - the big hall done in Egyptian architecture style, at which it is the fashion to laugh - and I greatly loathe the arabesque furniture and fittings of most of the rooms.  We have quite a row of pleasant rooms, bringing up with a big sitting room in the corner - all of them look out upon the large garden of the hotel, with overhanging balconies - and from the window of the sitting room where I am writing I see a lovely vista of palms and stately lubbek trees and tropical shrubs, among which the big gray and black crows are always flying and croaking.  The grass is very good too, and several Arabs are always sprinkling it and pushing about the lawn mower, which looks strange in such hands - and I like to watch the gray bearded old Mohammedan who keeps the gate just below us - sitting for hours leaning against his little gate house, with his goolah of water by his side.  Occasionally he takes a drink from this, or admits some one who stops to chat with him, or spreads his rug and says his prayers.  He wears coarse stockings and red shoes - a dignity to which he has not long been accustomed, or to which he has not yet Page 4comfortably adapted himself, for he wrestles much of the time with them - puts the red shoes side by side in front of him, and loses himself in contemplation of them - takes off the stockings - scratches his legs - and then resigns himself to the comfort of natural bare feet - until he hears someone approaching and scrambles back into the livery of civilization.  We pay the penalty of having rooms looking to the garden by having them invaded by hordes of mosquitoes.  I have been out of the house but once - on Sunday morning when I drove down with Theodore and Nettie to see our dahabeah, the Herodotus, which Mohammed has had engaged for us for months, and which is now in complete sailing readiness.  We were much pleased with the boat - she is 18 ft. broad and 105 in length and carries 12 sailors beside the Captain, 2d Captain, and the Captain’s son - a boy of 15, who serves as deck cook for the men.  Nettie was in raptures with it all, as indeed she is with everything.  Some pleasant people who crossed with us in the Hydaspes are sitting opposite us at table here - Sir George Macpherson-Grant and his family.  My cold was so bad for two days that I have not been down stairs - and go from my own room where I have a lamp burning all day to keep up the temperature, to the sitting room which is warmed all day by the sun.  As some sort of a compensation I have pleasant daily visits from Dr. Sandwith - while the rest are out all day, seeing the sights of this beautiful Cairo.Page 5Third Sunday in Advent.  Dec. 11th.              I have had a dull week - but am better - walked out on Friday, and yesterday drove out - went with Mohammed to get some plants for the boat.  This morning when Howard came home from church I walked down the street with him to a confectioners and bought a lot of Xmas things for the sailors.  Theodore reports Mr. Tylor as having started up the river in the Kitty, the same little boat that Mr. Chester used to have, and that kept us company for so many weeks on the river two years ago.  Mr. Peto too, another Hydaspes acquaintance is now looking about for a small dahabeah, but has found nothing yet to suit his fastidious taste.  We start up the river ourselves tomorrow, provided there is any wind.  Mohammed has everything ready.  The contracts have been considered and reconsidered - and formally signed.  Theodore pays Rostivitete Bey the owner of the boat £120 each for the first and second months and £100 for the third month - and £3. a day after the third month.  Mohammed furnishes the cook and 2 men servants and our living (for 6 people) for £5.10 a day.  I am full of delight to be once more starting up the Nile.Dahabeah “Herodotus”.  Dec. 14th              We came on board Monday morning, Dec.  12th and settled ourselves with much delight in our pleasant and commodious quarters.  We quite filled the big omnibus from Shepheards with ourselves and our bags and rugs.  The boat was lying just above the bridge on the Cairo side, and it was easy to reach her.  The day was a quiet one, but              Page 6early in the afternoon the sailors polled us out in the stream, and about 4 o’clock our Rais taking advantage of a little wind, started, and we made a very slow progress of about 5 miles, pulling up at sunset for the night.  As we left our landing place, one of Cook’s dahabeahs, the “Ammon Ra” flying the American flag, pulled under the bridge and took our place.  We have been busy settling ourselves.  Mrs. Davis and I have opposite rooms next the cabin - quite large with excellent beds, and sofas - washstands with running water - mirrors - lockers - book racks and easy chairs - two windows in each room - Nettie is next me in a room not so large as mine, and Howard opposite her.  Then come Jones and the bath room opposite each other, and the stairway to the deck - and then the big stern room, with its outside balcony, which is Theodore’s, and is most comfortable and pleasant.  Our big upper deck, which is really a sitting room is charming with its rugs, easy chairs, divans and tables.  The cabin is large enough not to seem crowded with Nettie’s piano - and looks most homelike.  Yesterday was absolutely quiet - the water like glass, & very warm.  We had an awning stretched over the deck, and we polled and drifted in the face of the strong current, all day - until we gave it up in the afternoon, and anchored, having made hardly more than a mile, and still having the Citadel in view.  This morning we made an early start - passed Bedrechein soon after breakfast - a fair wind, increasing in the afternoon to strong - the succession of pyramids before us all day long.  How strange those great things always are! and seen from a distance how they dominate the land, and make plain their enormous size.  Page 7              A very great contrast this opening journey is, to the one we made 2 years ago, when we started out with a rattling cold wind, that carried us up to Benisoef the second day.  Made 40 miles today.Dec.  15th.              We have made a fair run of 30 miles today - and passed this afternoon the very pleasant looking Gov.  dahabeah, the “Miriam”, with Mr. de Morgan, now Superintendent of the Ghizeh Museum, on board with a party of friends.  The day has been delicious - very warm - and I bask in the dry, pure, sweet air from the desert, finding it entrancing.  We are lying tonight a few miles below Benisoef.  I have been looking through a window at the starlit night - no moon - but stars so intensely brilliant - Orion superb - but in a most unusual position to my northern eyes.Dec.  16th.              An excellent run today of about 51 miles - to where we are now lying somewhere near Golosseneh.  The wind has been very strong at times - and the current so strong, caused by the very high Nile of this year, and such numbers of working boats, that it has made the sailing very exciting.  How effective these great winged sails of the boat are! Looking behind us again and again to-day, it was like a flock of great white birds coming after us.  It is now past 10 o’clock.  Nettie, Howard and I are writing at the table in our large pretty, well              Page 8lighted cabin.  Theodore is reading Petrie’s “Ten years digging in Egypt”.  I have just been to the door opening on the lower deck, to look at the ever strange night scene.  The sailors are all wrapped in their blankets lying asleep on the floor.  Mahommed and our Rais, with innumerable shawls wrapped about their heads, sitting on the floor crooning together - and on the shore the bright fire of the “watcher man” as Mohammed calls them - who are paid for guarding us through the dangers of the night, and who invariably do it by sleeping soundly.Dec.  17th.              We laid at our resting place of last night near Golossaneh until about 11 o’clock - waiting for a breeze.  A delicious morning - air fresh and sun bright - we went ashore after breakfast and walked up and down on the hard level black mud.  The usual Egyptian village of mud houses embowered in palm trees was near us, and over the stretch of freshly ploughed ground that lay between, and into which, men were busy transplanting onions, a thing I had never seen done, came a string of children and fellaheen to stare at us, and to lie in wait for possible backsheesh.  The first one I met, was a little mother, looking hardly more than a child herself, with a really sweet, clean baby - almost naked - indeed its only dress was a spare corner of its mother’s garment, such a very little red bronzy baby it was, with perfectly rounded plump legs and feet - its little round brown head covered with the blackest hair, and its sleepy eyes when it opened them, as big and softly black              Page 9as its little mother’s.  When she opened her dress and showed me this baby curled up in her arm, I was strongly tempted to take it in mine.  Then came dozens of others, until I think the village had disgorged itself of all its babies - but none at all so nice as my first brown little mannikin.  I wanted to photograph some of them, and sent Jones to the boat for my camera, but as soon as I had placed the tripod, half of the crowd took to its heels, but was finally lured back by Mohammed producing several oranges.  Many of the people were much tattooed.  I succeeded in getting two or three groups.  I should liked to have photographed a group I saw in the distance through my glass, swinging along the walls of the town under the palm trees - first an Egyptian gen d’armes in his European dress, with red fez, then 3 arabs chained and handcuffed together, followed by two or three dignified turbaned officials.  The wind came at last, but rather fitfully and in strong gusts - which made the sailing very exciting - we ran at times close to green fields, and the delicious scent of the scent trees was brought to us - with a general fresh spring like fragrance of all things growing - and the larks song - and the beautiful hoopoo birds showed themselves - and we passed lovely stretches of sand and desert lying up against the great limestone cliffs - little Coptic churches with their white domes showing in desolate places, with a fringe of palm and scent trees.  Passed the cliffs of Gebel et Ter, or mountain of the bird, with the Coptic Convent of Our Lady the Virgin, lying on its lofty plateau, looking poor and desolate against the sky line, and apparently hardly more than a collection of abject huts.  We stopped at sunset - having Page 10made only 18 miles, and are now about 10 miles from Minyeh.  The day after we started from Cairo, Mohammed produced a wretched little gray and white kitten, which he said he thought I might like - we found her swarming with fleas, and Jones valiantly offered to wash her - and a frightened, scrambling, scratching cat is no joke of a thing to wash.  We gave her a bath of strong carbolic soap and water and after she was dried, and had regained her contours, she was very pretty - and she is gradually growing tame and at home.  I have been busy for two days making curtains and lounge coverings for my room, out of some cheap pink and white chintz I bought in Cairo - and now the little room is very fresh and dainty - I could not live peaceably with the dark blue and orange and tinsel Turkish stuff, that I displaced.Dec. 18th.  4th Sunday in Advent.              Before I was dressed this morning, we were under way with a good breeze which increased to such violence, that rapid sailing seemed dangerous.  Still we kept on.  I found it too windy on deck, and have been below a good deal.  Passed Miniyeh soon after breakfast.  Referring to my diary of 2 winters ago on the river, I see that we reached Minyeh on the 3rd day of the voyage - and we are now on our 7th day!  We pulled up at last, about 11 o’clock, under a bank shaded by palms and scent trees - near a small dahabeah flying the English flag - the Manhatta - with Lord somebody Bentinck and family on board, her dragoman told Salah they were 18 days from Cairo! We all got off,  and took a lovely walk into the country back of the river.  We lay here              Page 11all the afternoon, and are still here - the wind being too strong to sail.  We have not looked very much like Sunday today.  For some days we have had some suspicions of the hold of our boat - and I declared at last that I heard water under the boards - so they were taken up, and to our consternation we found several inches of water on the iron bottom - all the men were set to work, and constant bailing went on until all was clean and once more dry, when Jones went under and thought he discovered the leak in the pipe leading from the bathtub.  We will be able to tell tomorrow.  Anything else might prove a serious thing.  We have made 22 miles, and have been joined by one of Cook’s Postal boats, which lies just behind us.Dec. 19th.              We left our mooring place of last night about 9 o’clock - passed the Beni-Hassan landing place, reserving that for our downward journey - passed Rhodah, nearly opposite which are the ruins of Antinoë, where Antinous is said to have drowned himself, and where Hadrian afterwards built a town, hardly anything now remaining of its ruins, though important remains were seen by the French Expedition.  Some miles further on, still on the east side of the river, we pass Der en-Rakbeh the “convent of the date palms” - near which is the important tomb with the celebrated representation of the transportation of a Colossus - so well know from the print in Wilkinson.  This we hope to see on our way down.  Then we pass Tell el-Amarnah, with the famous grotto tombs, where not long since the grave of Khu-en-aten (Amenophis IV) the sun              Page 12worshipper was discovered, and the equally famous Tel el-Amarnah tablets, now in the British Museum, of such great historical value.  The day was cold and windy, and I spent most of my time below, very busy with my writing and work.  Early in the afternoon we passed the Wilbur dahabeah, and the Gazelle with the Austrian flag.  About 4 o’clock the wind being very violent, and approaching the great chain of the Gebel Aboufeydah on the east bank, where the river makes two or three great bends, and is the most difficult piece of navigation between Cairo and Assouan, we took refuge to some lofty cliffs, and tied up for the night.  It was most exciting seeing our sailors climbing up our big boom to furl the sail, in the howling wind.  Soon after we stopped, the English dahabeah Manhatta came up behind and stopped, and in a few moments was followed by the Gazelle, which took a position just ahead of us.  Everybody went for a walk - met the Bentincks who stopped to talk.  Climbed the cliff a little way to look at some empty tombs, and tried to get in the gate of a little Coptic mosque, with no success - saw some fine Dom palms,  and our men got us some of the nuts.  Coming back, it was such a pretty sight - the three boats lying against that desolate shore, a long low island covered with shrubs shutting us off on the other side from the broad, shallow channel of the river - the beautiful clear sunset colors giving such an air of peace to everything.  Coming on board, it looked so comfortable to see the men wrapped in their shawls after their hard day, and crooning about their little deck stove - I hope they feel half as comfortable as they looked.  Much visiting in the evening between Page 13the different crews - and three groups of guards with their fires, on shore.  Made 41 miles.  The ground near us is green with the young wheat, 5 and 6 inches high.Dec. 20th.              Before getting up this morning, I lay looking at the mists rolling off the river, curling themselves into fantastic shapes as the sun gradually dried and scattered them.  There are sliding outside shutters to the windows, and one the sailors is always sent around the boat in the morning, walking along the outside ridge, to open them, and it is a lazy pleasure to lie in bed and watch the outside world.  We are lying this evening within 10 miles of Assiout.  We have been all day passing the Aboufoydah chain - and the Nile makes many great bends below Assiut, and it is often very tiresome and troublesome getting along here.  The Austrian and English dahabeahs have been near us all day - and when the wind fell quite light in the afternoon, the Gazelle being smaller and lighter than we are overtook us just as we drew to our landing place.  We have made 27 miles today - it has been rather cold, and I have been down stairs most of the day, busy with my letters for the mail tomorrow.Dec. 21st.              After breakfast this morning, we went on deck to see the minarets of Assiut, which we hoped to reach very early - but the wind failed, and it was not until after 12 o’clock, that we drew to the Page 14landing - the Gazelle having gone in just before us.  The usual scenes took place - amusing to Theodore and me, and wildly exciting to the rest, who had never witnessed anything of the kind - the gathering of the donkeys, and donkey boys and men - the mad rush for our saddles when they were brought up - the shrieks and yowls - the blows and kicks from the gens d’armes - and then after the donkeys had been chosen, sudden peace!  After lunch was over, we waited until half past 2 o’clock the sun was [sic; not] so hot, before starting for the town.  It was delightful to be riding along again in these well remembered scenes.  I had a charming donkey, “name he Telephone”, as my donkey boy informed me.  We went first to the Post Office, but finding it closed, kept on to the town and bazaar, where we bought ammonia, and Persian Insect powder, and Carbolic Acid, and wire, and a crochet needle!  Then we rode about in a general way, stopping at a large garden where I had been before, and got some sprays of Bougainvillia, then brought up again at the P.O. where we deposited our 21 letters and brought away a huge mail of letters and papers, which occupied us all the evening.Dec. 22.              Left Assiut this morning - day hot and still.  Have made only 5 miles.  We had quite an excitement last night.  Theodore, Nettie and I were the last ones up - after I had entered my room and lighted my candles, I saw a most disgusting and horrible monster on the mosquito netting - to my excited imagination he looked a foot or more in length, Page 15with 2 enormously long antennae, which as he waved them at me, threw their shadow on the wall in a ludicrously exaggerated manner.  I went to Theodore and Nettie for assistance, and we tried to bag the creature with no success - he dropped on the bed, ran behind it and disappeared - and although we pulled everything to pieces, we could not find him.  So Theodore nobly proposed that I should occupy his room, and he would take mine, and brave the danger of the reappearance of the beast.  I was base enough to accept, and gladly went to the big stern room for the night.  This morning on telling Salah about it at breakfast, he protested that it should be looked into at once, and soon had the men in the room - bed taken to pieces, drawers taken out from underneath, and Jones putting a candle in and then his hand, declared he saw the monster as “long as his foot”, and with a towel grabbed him and brought him out.  He really proved to be about 3 inches long, and to my great relief I saw that he was a flying insect, and did not reside on the boat with his uncles, aunts and cousins.  Jones put him under a glass, and treated him to large doses of Persian powder, and intends carrying him home as a specimen of Egyptian game.  However everything in the dahabeah was turned out, this morning - floors washed with hot water - carpets shaked and brushed, and my room treated to doses of Carbolic acid, and plentiful sprinklings of Persian powder - and we hope never to see a thing of that kind again.  The water has been like glass today - the men have tracked a little - and we laid a long time near a field through which the clover crop was springing - and had firm ground near the water for quite a walk.Page 16Dec. 23d.              Two miles today, with so much exertion, we gave it up - I am impressed again with the almost level and unbroken mountain chain following the bank on the eastern side, from Cairo - the great limestone cliffs making an almost unbroken sky line - and their colors so soft - and their shadows so pink and gray - we pass great bends in the river, and then seem to come back to the identical cliffs.Dec. 24th.              We have made 8 miles today and have passed Aboutig.  The men have been getting palm branches and sugar canes for tomorrow’s decoration.Dec. 25th.  Christmas Day.              When I went into the cabin this morning to arrange some modest little gifts about the table, I found Salah had been busy with his decorations, and the cook had sent in all the wonderful dishes he had prepared in honor of the day.  A large pyramid of nougat in the form of a Greek temple was in the centre of the table, with artificial roses and a pink cupid inside the temple!  two pyramids of cakes overlaid with coloured icing and bonbons, flanked the temple - and dishes of brilliant candies and bonbons were grouped about.  A mass of roses and fragrant white jasmine was really lovely - around the room were other flowers, and branches of oranges and mandarins in their own green leaves were hung - Salah was delighted as the faithful Page 17fellow always is, with our approbation.  I had bought in Cairo, a lot of pictured horns of plenty filled with candy, and tied with pretty ribbons for the sailors, and some more pretentious bonbonières for the other men, and Xmas cards for all.  After we had finished breakfast, we went out to the lower deck, and I gave them about, Theodore supplementing them with a gift of money to each.  Their delight was so childish, it was quite pathetic - and during the day I saw one and then another examining this [sic; his] treasures, and treating himself to a bit of candy.  Of course our gifts to our magnificent Salah (as we generally call Mohammed, there being so many other Mohammeds on the boat) were quite apart from all the rest.  It was not easy to think that this was Christmas, whatever it might be at home and in northern lands - and last night we could repeat Tennyson’s couplet and say, “We live within the strangers land, and strangely falls our Xmas eve”.  When about 9 o’clock I took my little weather observation the thermometer stood at 58°!  A pleasant surprise when we went on deck was the beautiful decoration - palm branches and masses of the sorghum or sugar cane, the latter will serve the further purpose of supplying the men with their favorite sweet, for all Egyptians love to suck the sugar cane, which is sold everywhere in the streets of the town, and along the roadside for that purpose.  When night came, and we had pulled up to the bank near Gou, coloured lanterns were run up to both the masts, and we had fireworks - and Nettie and Howard got off some of the entertainments they had prepared for the men, with great success.  There has been no wind today to speak of - and although we have made Page 18about 10 miles, it has been done by tracking and polling.  Pleasant as our life is here, we begin to complain that the wind does not blow, the good north wind that carries boats up the river.  Yesterday with all our efforts we made only 8 miles, and the day before only 2, - such a contrast to our other voyage, when we reached Luxor on the 14th day of our voyage - and today we are only within 38 miles of Sohag, and 171 from Luxor.  The weather is very different too - then it was cold and often cloudy - now it is like our June weather at Newport - and only in the early morning is it sometimes cloudy - yet though the progress has been slow, the hours have been to me so full of quiet beauty, that they have gone only too fast.  The beauty of the noonday is something exquisite - I revel in it - and the air of the desert is so pure, so soft and fresh - so lifegiving.  I have picture after picture in my mind of low, sandy shores, with stretches of green, and the soft yellow of the limestone cliffs beyond - and fringes of palm trees, and graceful masses of soft fragrant scent trees - and strange low villages of mud hovels - with shrouded figures moving about or huddled against the walls - and distant noises of voices - of barking of dogs - and through it all we slip mysteriously along, to the music of the soft ripple of the water - through the intense hot noon day, or the brilliant evening.Dec. 26.              Another quiet day without wind.  Gazelle close to us - sometimes in advance - sometimes behind - it becomes almost embarrassing              Page 19to pass so often and so close.  It is some Austrian nobleman, with his wife, governess and child - and he is always playing chess on the upper deck.  We have been passing the lofty cliffs of Sheikh el-Hereedeh coming sometimes close to the river - have made 6 miles, and after hoping all day to make Sohag, we are still several miles away.Dec. 27.              Passed Sohag this morning soon after breakfast in a good wind and seeing the Bazelle [sic; Gazelle] had stopped there, we hoped we had shaken her off at last - but alas! in the difficult bend of the river between Sohag and Akmin, we came to grief on a sand bank where we stayed an hour and she sailed past us again.  The town of Akmim was a most interesting place as we sailed past it - and has some special points of interest to lovers of antiquity - and we have resolved to stop there on our way down.  We had a splendid wind the rest of the day - we could see the Gazelle in the distance, and a small dahabeah which we take to be the Kitty.  Pulled up at Girgeh soon after 6 o’clock - and will stay here until day after tomorrow to bake bread.  It is vexing to stop so long where there is nothing to be seen.  There is always a strife between the Captains and the owners of the dahabeahs, in this matter of baking bread.  The former have a preference for certain places, and declare it can be baked nowhere else.  Our best sailing day for sometime - have made 31 miles.Page 20Dec. 28th.              We are lying by a low sand island with quite a little stream between it and the busy landing place - so that we are separated from its noise and dirt, and yet can see the stream of travel up and down the path on the bank.  Girgeh has a very pretty effect with its tall minarets, and the great cliffs of the Arabian mountains opposite.  It is an important town of nearly 15,000 inhabitants - a large proportion of which are Copts - and the name is Christian, from “Girgis” the Captain of St. George who is their patron saint.  When we were here before I remember going through the bazaar, and seeing an interesting fair, and being allowed to look into an old Mosque with lovely Saracenic tiles.  The rest went off quite early in the felucca to do the town - and I not feeling up to it stayed at home all day reading and working, finding the shaded deck a charming resting place, with all the many interesting things going on outside.  Salah has been doing a tremendous shopping in the way of live stock - and it was entertaining to see the boats arriving with sheep and chicken and pigeons and turkeys.  At last, our little island looked like a veritable farm yard, with two wooly black sheep nibbling at a heap of green stuff, and innumerable fowls picketed about, and one of the amusements of the day was to see a thin old cantankerous cock, with an equally gaunt old brown hen, and another plump little gray hen very much snubbed and kept in order by the old brown hen, who had established themselves near the gangway, and who I think were the sole survivors of the large family we had brought from Cairo - and of Page 21course were entitled to certain airs of possession.  But it was killing to see the state of mind the old cock was in as the other fowls began to arrive - he grew more and more furious as two or three other cocks began to wander about, and the brown hen had to bring him home again and again after his furious excursions.  Indeed she was most faithful to him in every way, and did not at all countenance his bland exception of any of the strange young hens, but hustled them off the scene quite as ferociously as she helped him fight his cocks.  At last after a family of 5 turkeys had been introduced to the island, and began strutting about he could be restrained no longer - fight after fight occurred - the valiant old fellow sallying out again and again to the conflict with the five - he was simply picked out of the contest time and time again, and was a most battered old fellow with one eye shut up and feathers gone, and a man had to be hired to watch him and keep the peace until the coops were ready and he was shut away from his enemies.  In the afternoon Theodore stayed at home with me and we had tea on deck, and tonight every thing is ready, and all hoping for a good wind tomorrow.  The bread all baked, and ready to be cut and dried.Dec. 29th.              To our dismay this morning a strong south wind was blowing, and we made no pretense of getting away until after 2 o’clock in the afternoon - and with a little wind and much tracking we made Balliana 8 miles away, at 7 o’clock this evening.  Cook’s steamer, and 2 dahaPage 22beahs near us - one the Kitty.  For two or three days we have been in the pigeon country - the houses with their pigeon towers, looking like strange fortresses and pylons - and altogether strangely picturesque.  But these are not the pigeons for eating, but are kept for their valuable manure, which collected and dried forms the chief fuel.Dec. 30th.              The weather being so quiet this morning, we devoted the day to Abydos - Nettie in some trepidation committing herself for the first time to a donkey.  The paths and towns looked so familiar - first along the river bank, then through the towns and out across part of the Libyan desert - but charming as it was, it was not so pretty as the last time we did it, as we now are so much earlier, and the crops not so far advanced.  I remember them as being quite as high as our donkeys - Nettie was full of delight over her first temple - and it seemed far more wonderful to me than ever - its beautiful colours, its exquisitely cut reliefs - the famous picture of Seti Ist, its splendid columns.  We lunched sumptuously in the hypostyle hall - and afterwards encountered Mr. Tylor looking miserably ill.  He introduced his friend Mr. Somers-Clarke, particularly interested in Coptic things - an extremely pleasant fellow, and after dinner this evening, they came over and made us a long visit.  Mr. Tylor has been in America and seems to know everyone - has visited the John Bancrofts in Boston.  The ride back to the boat in the heat of the afternoon was very tiring - my donkey was poor, and my saddle too big - Nettie was so overcome with Page 23fatigue, that we had to stop and rest her.Dec. 31st.              Calm and hot - our sailors tracked for 6 or 7 miles - early in the afternoon we pulled up discouraged - the Kitty just behind us- and Mr. Tylor and Sommers-Clarke came over for awhile, and we all went for a stroll.- Cloudy all day.Jan.  1st.              Utterly quiet weather - the atmosphere as motionless as the water - and, by tracking about 5 miles - overcast the whole day, and a few drops of rain fell in the afternoon.Jan. 2d.              Again a quiet day, and very warm.  The thermometer which hangs in the shade on the little balcony outside Theodore’s room, but which gets a little warmth from the reflection from the water, stood at 10 o’clock this morning at 72°.  Tracking for 4 miles brought us about sundown within 4 miles of Farshoot, and we drew up with the Kitty beside us at the head of a beautifully luxuriant valley on the west side, the great cliffs on the east side coming quite to the river, and reflecting the sunset glow in most etherially delicate tones in pink and yellow, with the shadows in ashes of roses colour.  We had a walk under the palms, and scent trees - with their little puffy balls of fragrant yellow flowers - and many dôm palms - a beautiful crop of the flat pea, Page 24which they call gulbân growing under them, with its violet coloured blossom.  After we got back to the boat there was such wonderful beauty abroad, that we could hardly tear ourselves from the deck, to go down and make ourselves ready for dinner.  Over the cliffs opposite, the pink afterglow of the sunset began to give place to a clear white radiance, and soon the full moon sailed majestically up, making a magical beauty.Jan. 3.              Very hot - and no wind - thermometer at noon 79°.  Referring to this date in my diary of 2 years ago, I find that at 8 o’clock in the morning, it stood at 45°!  We tracked along to Forshoot, which we passed at noon.  The chief feature of the place is the large sugar factory of the Khedive, which makes anything but a pretty spectacle, with its tall black chimneys and belching forth smoke - the gangs of half naked men unloading the sugar cane, and loading boats with bales of sugar - the cries - the shouting - the turmoil, the toiling men - the overseers with their sticks - the long line of big boats, past which our sailors laboriously carried our towing rope - was not a pleasant thing to see in the hot noon day.  Heavens!  the groans of the toiling men this ancient river has listened to!  Mr. Tylor and Mr. Somers-Clarke spent the evening with us.Page 25Jan. 4.              Morning motionless - very hot - thermometer 82° - wind light in the afternoon and increasing - and now at 11 o’clock Salah has just come in to say to Theodore that the Captain is going to anchor in the stream as there are no towns near, and I went to the door with him, while he pointed out the loneliness of the situation - the Libyan desert on the right, and the Arabian on the left.  What exquisite stillness there was - the soft lapping of the water - the brilliant stars - the tired men grouped about on their deck.  It gave one such a feeling of comfort on coming back to the pretty brightly lighted saloon, to think of the wide desolation of the desert without.  We passed the village of Hou, where lived a famous Moslim saint, who sat for 53 years naked on the bank of the river.  Some of our sailors said prayers, and threw offerings in the river - for a blessing from the dead saint.  At Kosr-el-Sayd  the Kitty pulled up - Mr. Tylor and Somers-Clarke intending to visit the tombs there.  I do so enjoy the delicious warmth of these days - never oppressive because of the entrancing air from the desert - and such noon days!  Sitting on deck under the awnings, shielded from the intense sunlight, the soft intense blue of the sky, the brilliant green strip of cultivated land, and the delicate yellow of desert and cliff, all seem to be dissolving and palpitating in the opalescent air.Jan. 5.              Another warm and quiet day - at 4 P.M. the thermometer stood Page 26at 80°.  We tracked about four miles, almost within sight of Keneh when the rope parted, and we waltzed out into the current, turning completely around.  Such a hubbub!  such sounding Arabic gutterals and telling gesticulations!  When composure again reigned, we pulled to the anchor across the river, out of the dangerous current, where we are now lying.  There have been occasional flashes of lightning during the evening - and growlings of thunder.  Our little cat Mish-mish grows in size and favour every day - and is a darling - though a bit wild and savage in her play - she comes to my room often in the morning and demands entrance.  The other night while we were sitting at dinner, I heard great commotion, we were sailing slowly, Salah rushed from the room, and I knew Mish-mish was overboard - two or three men went over after her, and found her clinging to the rudder - she was dried and brought to life on the kitchen range, Hanna, the cook, being very fond of her.  Mish-mish is the Arabic for apricot, and seems to be universally used for cat in this country.  Ours is growing fat and clean - and is no more a Cairo cat.Jan. 6.              Last night when I went to bed, the thunder was growling in an ominous fashion, and I went to sleep with the soothing sound of a gentle rain in my ears.  I heard it in the night when I awakened, and towards the morning it became harder and steadier.  I wondered sleepily why I heard no one stirring above on deck - and thought of the sailors’ bread baked at Girgeh and which had been lying on the deck floor drying Page 27in the sun ever since.  The poor fellows were too tired from the last few days of hard work, polling and trucking [sic; tracking], and were too sound asleep to heed the rain, for no one stirred, until I heard Theodore just before it grew light prowling about, wakened it seems by a leak on his bed.  He aroused M.S.  who in turn aroused the crew, who began a noisy knocking about of things and mopping of the deck.  There was the very debbil to pay as M.S. said.  The skylight in the saloon had been left open as is our custom at night for ventilation, and the rain had run down the hanging lamp, spoiling the pretty blue shade with its blue ribbons that Nettie and I had made, and then descended upon the table beneath, where many of our books were lying, and now Baedeker, Budge and Mariette volumes look sadly the worse for their shower bath.  Various little droppings, and trickling streams came through in unexpected places, for these boats are seldom rain proof.  Fortunately we were lying at a large, low, wide spreading sand bank, where we still are, as a high south wind has been blowing all day, and we are waiting for better things - and what  a spectacle we have presented today!  The men turned out on the sand this morning all their wet clothes and blankets - hung about the boat our wet rugs and cushions, and we had the look of a much bedraggled carpet bazaar.  The wind had been blowing hard from the south, and of course dead against us - and sorry as we were not to get on, we have had a lovely day.  There is something fascinating in these enormous stretches of sand, hard enough to be springy and rippled over, like shallow water with a light wind.  The air came soft, but cool and invigorating from the desert, the sky was gray with Page 28heavy ominous clouds, which towards evening broke away, giving a gorgeous, and not at all usual Egyptian sunset.  In the morning we roamed over the sand, sketching on its smooth surface - and actually ran races, so much did this life giving air of the desert intoxicate us.  Our dismal men looked at us in amazement - and sat huddled together in all their wraps, as cheerful as fowls in rainy weather.  At sunset Theodore and I walked to the extremest verge of this sand island, enjoying the stillness, and the lonely desert scene.  Ah me!  what delicious moments of quiet these are.  At such times one feels the fascination of the simple nomadic life - and in any emergency like a failure of health, or fortune, I would much rather take up with life in the desert, such as I could make it, with some refinements of civilization, than with all the luxuries of a fashionable health resort.  Thermometer 64° at 9 o’clock A.M.Jan. 7.              We started with a fair wind at 6 o’clock this morning - but at 11 o’clock it turned dead ahead - and our poor fellows had to take to tracking again - which they did until this evening, when we had a wind for an hour, and pulled up near Nagada, having made 20 miles.  We used to think that no crew could equal that of our old “Nubia” - and indeed we can never quite think of our present Rais with the same feeling we do of old Raid Achmed - and Hanna Ibrim our cook was with us also in the Nubia - but the rest of the men are very interesting and each one has developed a personality quite his own.  The Nubians Page 29all I believe possess a personal dignity and presence natural to them.  One day, soon after leaving Cairo, when the sail was shifted in a sharp breeze, one of the men I had never noticed before, received a blow from the heavy rope on his head, which knocked off his tarboosh and scarf, and sent them into the river.  He was quite angry, as it was the fault of one of the other men - and my attention was called to him by his fine dignified gesticulations, and I saw what a well made handsome fellow he was, as he stood wiping a little blood from his cheek and neck.  I told Salah to tell him sometime that I would give him a new head gear and two or three days after that, as we were lying by and he had just come back from a walk with Nettie and Howard, he came up to the deck where I was sitting alone, with a bit of flowering mint in his hand, and gave it to me with a manner that was superb.  His name is Nase - but we have dubbed him “the Haughty” - and no blasé worldling, of the best and most refined type, could excel him in graceful indifference of manner, or haughty repose.  He is one of the singers of the crew - and seems to be the wit, for his quiet remarks at which he never laughs himself are frequently followed by shouts of laughter from the other men.  He is the readiest fellow in any difficulty or emergency - can speak a few words of English, and in his clever way gets our meaning at once.  He has me now at all times under his respectful but indifferent watch - and when I want anything done, Nase is generally there to do it.  But I grieve to say that my Haughty has on one or two occasions been on a jag as Howard says - and Theodore is so unkind as to suggest that the noble indifference of manner is sometimes the Page 30result of hashash.  Then there is our second Captain, Rais Fuley (whom we like much better than Rais Mahommed our 1st Captain) quiet and reposeful - with such a presence and dignity - and a brown man who is neither handsome or magnificent, and who wears no shoes or stockings and whose outer garment is simply a long black or blue cotton robe, must have a real dignity and simplicity of character to give such presence.  He is a very faithful Mohammedan too - is constant in his prayers - eats no meat - and drinks nothing but coffee and water.  He is a great contrast to Rais Mohammed who has the most noisy and masterful ways, and when he gets excited which is often enough, talks more like an angry turkey gobbler than any human I have ever heard.  There is always one sailor told off to go with each lady of the party wherever she goes.  Nettie has a fine fellow Hassan, and I have a cheerful, clean smiling fellow, Mohammed Ibrahim who is a treasure.  The Captain’s boy Ali, is a handsome little devil, whom we all like - and there is his cousin little Kamyl who is being taken to his home somewhere up the river, a boy of 8 years old I should think - who is the petted darling of his crabbed uncle, Rais Mohammed.Jan. 8th.  1st Sunday after Epiphany              We started tracking at 8 o’clock this morning - and kept it up until one o’clock - then we had a favorable wind until 3:30pm - then dead against us until dark.  We had hoped to reach Luxor today, but have pulled up for the night within 4 or 5 miles of it, having made only 12 miles today.  It has been cool all day.Page 31Jan. 9.  Luxor.              With much tracking and polling, starting not until 10 o’clock this morning, we came along to Karnac, landing about 4 o’clock at the Gezireh opposite - it gave us time to walk over to the great temple - which we did through the pleasant fields - sending Howard Jones and M.S. on donkeys to Luxor for the mail.  We entered by the latest and great pylon - and met the very fine looking and friendly guide whom we well remembered.  Nettie was overwhelmed with her first sensations - and to me it was more wonderful than ever.  Here, as at Abydos, we noticed recent and careful repairs rather than restorations, showing the thorough supervision that exists now over these Egyptian monuments.  When we came out of the chaos of ruins in the older buildings, near the sacred lake - we sat down to look about us, until the others arrived from Luxor, with heaps of papers and letters.  I took one of the donkeys with the man’s saddle to ride back, while the rest walked - as we passed through a part of the town near the temple, a party of Busharin met us, and we stopped to look at their dancing - savage looking things they are with their bushy hair and black faces and bodies, and their white clothes - but their smiles were most friendly.  Lovely effects going back to the river bank, under the splendid palms, and through the blooming crops - the cattle and sheep going home from work in the fields, or resting in groups - smoke curling up from the little mud houses - the voices of children and barking of dogs in the distance - the splendid ancient river reflecting the clear gold of the sky, and across, by the side of a wide sand island Page 32or gesireh, our boat lying with its lights already glimmering through the windows.Jan. 10.              We all crossed in the felucca to Karnak this morning - Theodore, Mohammed and I going on donkeys to Luxor - the rest to the temple.  We  first went to the Luxor Hotel, where is Cook’s offices, and we read the telegrams posted there, and the various notices, and I enquired for the pelican of past memory, and was told he was not living.  Then we went to see our old friend Mohammed Mohassib, and his antiquities - nothing of special interest, except a figure in glazed pottery of a hippopotamus - bluish green, with figures and designs in a black tracery.  Theodore looked very carefully at it, but we have such fear of imitations, and the old fellow asked £100 for it - the figure no longer than this page - so we left it and went into one or two other places.  At the house of Todros the English Consul we saw many delightful things but preposterous prices asked.  We heard the Osiris with the Macpherson-Grants had arrived from up the river.  Back home again in time for lunch, and in the afternoon the rest wanting to go to Luxor, Theodore and I went over to Karnac where a donkey was waiting for me and we had a beautiful afternoon - all to ourselves barring our 2 sailors and donkey boys, and the pleasant guide.  I have been for days studying the temple plans and decorations, and we had our books with us.  It was lovely in that afternoon light.  After the big temples, we went to all the outlying ones - along the great pylon courts to the temple Page 33of Rameses III, and the lovely little temple of Khonsu, which I had never seen, as it has been quite excavated since we were here last, and one of its rooms was filled with excavating implements, which the guides told us were going to Kom Ombos.  Then we went to the few scattered remains of the immense temple of Mont, with its battered avenues of Sphynxes, and statues of Bast - and desolate desert surroundings of the spot, with a wretched little encampment of Busharin near by, was a picture to enjoy and think about.  In such a place, the present beauty of this wonderful old land, great as it is, is lost sight of in thoughts of its great past.  The evidences of a mighty and finished civilization, of thousands of years of life and toil and ambition and suffering are overwhelming, and make the present seem very small.  A still day - with no wind until late, from the South, and therefore not for us.Jan. 11.              This morning we pulled along our pleasant Gezireh up opposite Luxor, and so kept free from the noise and dirt of the town.  We are lying just opposite the new Tewfikyeh Hotel, owned by Gage & Co.  The Kitty has arrived, and we met Mr. Tylor this morning while we were prowling among the antiquity shops.  We saw some things of undoubted value, some statuettes especially - one of them a stone statue of Antif - Mr. Tylor translated the hieroglyphics on it for us - it was about 12 inches high - the face bearing that noble, far away living look that is characteristic of the best period of early Egyptian art.               Page 34Tadros asked £120 for it and Theodore would not buy it.  We hear disquieting rumours of a Dervish raid near Wady Halfeh - the English camel corps defeated and the commanding officer killed - which makes the prospect of going beyond the first Cataract very dubious.  It would be a harrowing disappointment to me.  Theodore called on the Grants this morning, the Osiris did not ascend the Cataract, but waited at Assouan, while Lady Grant and her son went up to Wady Halfa in one of the Postals with a guard of 16 soldiers from the Assouan garrison.  This was after the raid - and passengers were not allowed to go up for seven days following the raid.  This has been another day of light south wind.  We are now making a virtue of necessity, and as we have to wait until this South wind stops blowing, we are going over to the great sights among the hills - though we would rather push on, and leave sightseeing here until we come down with Mr. Fielding with us.  Jan. 12.              No wind today.  Some of them went over to the Ramessium, Goornah, Medinet Haboo this morning.  This afternoon we went to Karnac again, and home in time to receive the Grants to tea on their way home from the Tombs of the Kings.Jan. 13.              We were over in Luxor all the morning - walking about the temple, which is being thoroughly excavated - the splendid papyrus Page 35bud columns of the older temple are all shown now to their base.  The work goes rapidly on under a crowd of workmen, and several railway tracks carry the little cars full of useless rubbish to the bank of the river, where an unceasing cloud of dust now goes up, as they are made to tumble their contents over.  After lunch we rode out to Medinet Habou, which has also been extensively excavated, and where crowds of work men are busy in the vast rubbish heaps.  Nettie and I would like to have stopped and grubbed ourselves.  Another quiet day.Jan. 14.              We made an early start for the Tombs of the Kings this morning.  It was a perfect day for the expedition, which I had rather been dreading - much cooler than when we went before, so that with smoked goggles and veils, puggarees and parasols, we made the transit through that valley of desolation with comparative comfort.  We lunched at the entrance to one of the unfinished tombs as soon as we arrived, and then went to the tomb of Ramses IX, then to that of Rameses III, commonly called Bruce’s Tomb, or the tomb of the Harpers from the paintings on one of the small chambers of two men playing the harp.  Then to the greatest of all, that of Seti 1st or Belzoni’s tomb, who discovered it.  More than ever before was I impressed by the stupendous achievement, the attempted safety and secrecy, so utterly futile, in the midst of such chaotic desolation as these Libyan mountains present.  Instead of entering by the way we came, as we did before when we were here, we sent our donkeys on, with the exception of mine, and crossed the mounPage 36tain over to Der-el-Bahri, to the temple tomb of the great Queen Hatasu, or Hatshepsu, as it is now the fashion to call her - the clever daughter of Thotmes Ist, the wife and sister of Thotmes II, and the sister and regent of Thotmes III (who built our obelisk) - I had never before seen this beautiful spot - and we were fascinated with it, and promised ourselves a longer visit there, when we came down the river.  I would not, for anything, have missed the way over the mountain.  I had much the best of it of course, on my donkey - the rest having to climb and walk - but I being such a light weight, was permitted to ride.  The path led along the very edge of the cliff, and up and down various perpendicular places - but as the guide was leading the donkey, the donkey boy holding on to him behind, and one of our sailors at my side when the path was wide enough, I felt no responsibility and could enjoy the very extraordinary scene - except, when I looked down and back, at the poor toilers coming after me.  Nothing I have ever seen in nature makes so powerful an impression, as these desert mountains - desolation and chaos, and not a blade of any green or growing thing.  I was sorry I did not bring away some of the flint nodules that lie about everywhere.  When we began our descent, there was such an entirely precipitous path, that our guide said I must dismount, and I was taken by each arm, and dragged or skated down over the loose rubble and sand.  The view there, over the wide, luxuriant, verdant Theban plain, was charming, with the great Colossi seated in their eternal expectancy at the edge of the desert - and our ride home, through those fragrant fields in the late afternoon was the most beauPage 37tiful thing I have to remember.  It was a transit through happy Elysian fields!  There has been no wind - only little zephyrs from the south occasionally - and we begin to look rather serious when our friends chaff us about getting up the river this winter.  We are to lunch with the Grants tomorrow.Jan. 15.  2d Sunday after Epiphany.              This morning there was the usual perfect calm of water and air.  The rest crossed to Luxor for church and walking - and Theodore came back for me, to take me to the Osiris, which lies at the Luxor bank.  As we pulled over, the wind began to rise, and Theodore left orders with M.S. to have everything made ready to sail.  We had a charming visit - pleasant, nice people.  Sir George particularly, who is an unfortunate victim of gout.  Lady Grant is good natured, loquacious, masterful, with attractive manners.  Miss Grant very pretty, with big soft brown eyes, and that air of serene innocence that English girls have when they have not seen too much of the world.  Young Grant, nice and intelligent, with a German tutor, quite one of the party.  The Osiris is a fine boat - the cabin large and very pretty - the deck fine - but the rooms small - the double ones no larger than our single ones - but she has two bathrooms.  The two young people lunched on the Herodotus with Nettie and Howard.  No one waits on the Nile for ceremony when a favorable wind blows, and as the wind continued to hold, we hurried ourselves and came away immediately, we had finished lunch, passing on our way over the young Grants.  In a few Page 38minutes we were off in a fine, stiff wind, exchanging parting salutations with the people on the Osiris as we passed - but the wind proved very fitful, finally falling very light, and after making about 7 miles we have pulled up to the bank near Erment.  We do not want to quarrel with our mode of life, or do anything like complaining of the pleasant days that fly too swiftly by, but this slow progress is growing to be a serious thing.  Day after day M.S. says “I never see such a time on the river as this season” and looks very sad, seeming to feel himself responsible for this persistent quiet.  We found one of our old sailors “Yakoub” on the Osiris.Jan. 17.              Yesterday between a light wind and tracking we made about 28 miles, which quite encouraged us.  We passed Esneh in the evening, and tied up just beyond, and this morning when I went on deck, Theodore had about decided to visit the temple, but just then a light wind sprang  up, and we decided to sail, but the wind soon failed, and what progress we have made, about 7 miles, has been by tracking.  The day was hot and motionless.  We had a big awning up, and after lunch I had my little writing table carried on deck and wrote letters.  A perfectly golden sunset - not a speck of a cloud anywhere, and not the stir of the faintest ripple on the golden water.  It was hard to tear oneself away and go downstairs which I was made to do as I have not been exactly well for a day or two.  Every one says - all the books and doctors say that the hour of sunset has danger in it - and after the heat of the day, Page 39the extreme chill of the evening is very sudden.  Yet no one I have ever met, pays the slightest attention to it - and it is the hour of the most charming beauty - but thick wraps must be put on, before the chill is felt.Jan. 18.              I saw Esneh, when I went on deck after breakfast, across the great bend of the river that we had been so painfully getting around yesterday.  There has been no wind all day until after 5 o’clock - our poor men tracking in the broiling sun.  After that time we sailed along briskly until 7:30, when the night being so dark we brought up close to El Kab, having made 10 miles.  The Gazelle passed us in tow, having lost patience I suppose.  One of our amusements is planning a dahabeah, and fitting it in the most sensible and comfortable way - a most fascinating diversion.  It seems that they are all built in England, and Cooks newest dahabeahs are very pretty and luxurious, though the space is badly distributed.  The convenient manner the men have of rolling themselves in their rugs, and lying down to sleep on the deck, like so many mummies, makes very narrow quarters go a great way with them, and if you step out of the saloon door, and look about anytime after 10 o’clock, it is a curious sight.  While we, the pampered inhabitants of the interior complain if our luxurious beds are a bit uneven or hard.  I never feel such a poor result of civilization as I do when amongst these natives, whose physical strength and activity seem all that nature intended.  Barelegged and barefooted, with two or three cotton garments Page 40about them, they stride about in the sun and wind, indifferent to cold and heat - while we, swathed in woolens, and tied up in a dozen restraining ways, shiver in the wind, and faint and sicken in the sun.  Especially in the matter of feet, I feel our inferiority, as I note dozens of times a day that impress of their bare feet in the sand, or soft moist mud - the lines of the foot so straight and natural - the freedom of the toes, and their clinging, grasping power - the great toe apart and individual like a thumb - I declare there is quite as much difference between our cramped and distorted feet and theirs, as between the unnatural Chinese feet and ours!Jan. 19.              We are lying at Edfou tonight - 13-1/2 miles from El Kab - which we have made by much tracking and a very little sailing after 5 o’clock, when a fair wind sprang up and lasted about 2 hours.  We landed before sunset at a lovely bank of palms, a mile or so above the town.  The rest got off for a walk but I declined climbing the steep bank, and was enjoying a walk up and down the deck, when Howard came hurrying back to say I must come, that they had struck a Busharin settlement, and that a wedding was going on.  So Mrs. Davis and I were hurriedly paddled down the bank a way in the felucca, and with some of the men went ashore, and down a lane between walls and trees we went and came upon the settlement.  These wild children of the desert are always most interesting and picturesque - the straight delicate features, and strange curling, ringletty hair like a Russian poodle’s - Page 41with the bunchy arrangement of it, and their good carriage and beautiful small white teeth.  We were too late for the wedding cortège, but were shown a low tent, in which the bride was secluded, and to which she had been brought on a camel, attended by her friends - and before the tent stood the bridegroom with a drawn sword - a handsome fellow - and although he looked quite dramatic, showed a healthy interest in the question of baksheesh.  The women were making the shrill cry known as the zaghareth or joy cry - a shrill, high note, with the mouth rapidly touched with the fingers.  It sounds exactly like the cry heard also at funerals.  We were followed back to the boat by a curious crowd of men, women, children and dogs - and I was glad to escape from them, not for fear of them, but of the various inhabitants they kept about their clothes and persons.Jan. 20.              When I got out of bed this morning, I saw the donkeys and one very presentable horse, saddled and ready for us, and waiting with donkey boys and men to take us to the great Edfou temple - but the wind coming up so fine we decided not to stop longer, and Mohammed Salah went on shore to send the animals away and distribute proper baksheesh and then we spread our sails for Assouan!  It was 7:30 when we got off -  the wind increased and has lasted all day, so that we have made one of the very best runs of our voyage - 49 miles! We passed Silsilis at 2 o’clock and Kom Ombos at 6:30 - too late to see it, but as the night was clear and beautiful, it was effective perched on its height above Page 42the river.  We were on deck all day with our glasses, looking at the rock tombs and façades.  The banks in the neighborhood of Silsilis are very interesting - the river so narrow, and the great rocks come quite to the water.  We are now in the granite country - and are lying about 8 miles from Kom Ombos.  I took a lot of photographs today, principally of the crew.Jan. 21.              Assouan.  	We arrived early this afternoon and came almost to the identical spot of our old mooring ground at the island of Elephantine.  The approach to Assouan is beautiful - the shores are rocky, the yellow Egyptian has given place to the dark Nubian.  The Busharin give way to the handsome Ababdehs - which great tribe of Bedouins control the country in a great measure from the east bank of the river to the Red Sea.  Theodore and I saw many familiar things as we drew along the shore of Elephantine - but the quite imposing new hotel on the Assouan bank was not familiar, or the new military store house, with plaza in front and rows of guns between the freshly planted lebbek trees.  We drew up in front of a little steamer which we found occupied by Col. Wodehouse, or Wodehouse Pacha as he is called here, and Englishman, and commanding officer of the frontier, who has his headquarters at Wady Halfa and was the very person to whom we had to apply for permission to take our boat up the Cataract.  So instead of telegraphing to Wady Halfa, Theodore went to see him - he was very courteous and gave the permission saying that he did not think there was danger, Page 43that they had 3 gunboats cruising up and down the river between Kalabshi and Wady Halfa - and that in case of any trouble we would be turned back etc.  So Theodore decided at once to go, and informed the Captain and crew at once.  They are all delighted - Salah went over to Assouan this morning to send word to the Sheik of the Cataract, with whom a formal bargain must be made.  We crossed ourselves, in the felucca, went to the P.O.  and Telegraph office, and walked through the bazaar.  How delightful and strangely familiar it all seemed.  We had tea on deck after coming home - enjoying the view across the river of the town and shipping; the ruins on the hill opposite, and all the singular surroundings.  I recognized the great sycamore on the island near us - and the same old abandoned dahabeah drawn up on the bank under the trees.Jan. 22.  3d Sunday after Epiphany.              We have been over to the town both this morning and afternoon - walking about and buying at the Bazaar.  This morning the Sheik of the Cataract arrived, a grave, silver haired old man, and the bargain made for taking us up for £20.  These Bedouins of the Cataract have held the right of conveying boats up the rapids for time immemorial, so far as I know.  They surround it with great mystery and difficulty - and always require 2 days.  No doubt it could be done in quicker time and with fewer men.  They have had little practice of late years since the trouble with the Soudan, as until a year ago, no dahabeahs since the war have been allowed up.  The only way to reach Wady Halfa has been by Postal steamers, controlled by Cook, small and Page 44wretched, which go up and down in one week.  We are the first people this year who have asked for permission to ascend - and now that the dahabeahs are so large, and made (their hulls) of iron or steel, they are not often risked in the Cataract, as a bump on the rocks is much more serious for an iron boat, than a wooden one.Jan. 23d.              In spite of a high wind we went to the Grenfell tombs this morning - I would not have undertaken this expedition again, had I not hoped to see something new, as excavations have been going on along that cliff for sometime.  But we could see nothing of this but clouds of duSt. I hate these climbs in the hot sand, with the wind taking your very head off.  In the afternoon the rest went over to Assouan and took donkeys for a visit to the quarries, and to the barracks, and when the afternoon was a little on the wane Theodore and I walked on Elephantine, past the Nilometer, climbed to the Roman ruins, and scrambled over the debris of what had been human habitations for centuries.  It was rough walking but immensely interesting.  I had to stop once in a while to do a little grubbing - everything looked so promising, and I longed to have over some of the sailors with spades and things to dig - I picked up two very good nuggets of carnelian.  Then we turned into a village which proved to be the home of the sailor who was with us, Mehemet Ali - and he stopped to greet his friends here and there - until from out of one of the little mud hovels came out a clean grave looking woman whom Mehemet Ali greeted as his              Page 45mother - so we stopped to speak to her - and Theodore gave her 20 piasters - these people are all Nubians - and looked clean and bright - as did their villages - far, far better than those of lower Egypt.  The women are not veiled, and their mouths have a very peculiar look - I should think it must be caused by something they chew - or by an intentional stain - but the effect is ghastly - the gums very prominent and a bright purple or slate colour.  Then we walked by the river bank under the splendid palms, amid the creaking and groaning sakkiehs, which are numerous here, as the island is so cultivated, and it was charming indeed - for the air was full of pleasant odors from the blossoming crops, and the evening fires were beginning to send up their columns of blue smoke - women were filling their water jars at the river, and walking off with them strong and stately on their heads - flocks were being driven down to the river for water.  We came home through another village, where we saw several remnants of the past in the way of painted and carved temple stones let in to the modern walls  - and one great hieroglyphed monster stone which must have been an important member of some great temple.  For Elephantine has had a great and ancient history, dating from the 6th Dynasty, though so little remains to tell of it.  Our lower deck and the sand bank at which we lie, have been since yesterday morning pervaded by a lot of swarthy strangers, with voluminous white turbans and black gowns and white shawls squatting about in rows and groups - quiet and watchful - and when we ask who they are, we are told they are pilots of the Cataract, or Bedouins from Shellal - I think it has been so long since they have had anyPage 46thing to do in this line, that they are making the most of it.  There are several dahabeahs near us - Prof.  Sayce has arrived and is just behind us - and Mr. Wilbur with his American flag just in front of us.  We are all very busy writing letters this evening, laughingly declaring that they are our last words to our friends before our probable capture by Dervishes.  We get off tomorrow.Jan. 25th.              The unexpected has happened in the most disappointing and exasperating manner.  Instead of lying tonight as 
we had expected to do, in the smooth waters under the banks of lovely Philae, we are back again at our mooring place at Elephantine, which we left yesterday morning, exalting that we were bound for the Cataract.  We had hurried through breakfast, and on deck, where preparations were being made for our departure - and a large and select audience on the sand bank, Bedouins and people from the island who had come to see us off, were watching these with great interest.  One old gray bearded octogenarian every time we looked his way, waving his hands about and shouting blessings, and a safe passage to us, and then demanding baksheesh for his good wishes.  The Sheik of the Shellal with his special assistants of a half dozen Captains, and the same number of helmsmen, and two pilots were already on deck - with parcels and rugs and a coffee mill and coils of huge rope - for they always take 2 days for this business.  Then arrived one of the big Cataract boats with about 50 men, who with their big white turbans made a picturesque load - all coming on board.  Our Page 47own Rais Mahommed and his crew, had yielded their places and authority for the time.  The decks were cleared and everything made fast.  We made ourselves as small as possible, and refrained from parasols.  Back in the stern, near the helm, were a dozen or more brown fellows with flashing eyes, and as our anchor was brought in, and the cables slipped, and we glided off, all of them from the head Reis began to divest themselves of their shoes, and much of their clothing.  There was a good wind - we sailed rapidly along through the familiar scenery of the islands and wonderful rocks, and we began to feel much excited as we met with the stronger currents, and pulled finely around dangerous corners, and I felt a great elation that I was at last doing the thing I had for so many years wanted to do.  We were soon near the first big rapid, and touched upon a low sand bank to land the men and their ropes - and we could see from all over the rocks and islands other men coming with ropes - wading, swimming and with almost no clothing.  They fastened the ropes to various rocks and began to pull us ahead.  There had been a tremendous hubbub from the first - so much so that the wonder was that any order could be heard and understood - but now, the turmoil increased - all the captains shouted to each other, and to all the men - and all the men yelled to the Captains and to each other - they bellowed, they gesticulated, they roared - there was a difference of opinion between one of the helmsmen and the Sheik - the latter ran from his place at the top of one of the companionways back to the helm, and snatched it from the steersman - in the meantime we saw that our bow was rapidly approaching a jagged point of rock, and Theodore sprang up with a warnPage 48ing shout, saying “swing her bow out, swing her bow out,” and our own Rais and sailors then added their warning shouts and rushed to the rescue with bumpers, and their own bodies, but too late - she struck and knocked a hole in her bow about 3 inches below the water line.  Then there was dire confusion for a few seconds - I saw our sailors jumping into the hold, and pulling out the stores and things, and begin bailing the water - and Jones went in, and showed the men how to stop the leak - he brought out the piece of iron that had been stove in, and making a rapid sketch of the hole on the leaf of his pocket book, showed Theodore a plan for mending it, which I declared perfectly feasible.  All the while the Bedouins were shouting and prancing about in the water, until they understood what the damage was, when utter consternation fell upon them and Sheik, Captains and all stood helplessly staring at Theodore and Jones - it was such an illustration of the civilization of the East, versus that of the West - Theodore said to M.S. what is the Captain going to do?  He is waiting for your order sir, replied M.S. So Theodore ordered the boat eased back to the sand bank, and strongly anchored with both anchors, and her bow up, bringing the hole above water.  Then he decided to send Jones and M.S. into Assouan for help, and hailing one of the small Cataract boats that was passing, they went off, and in 3 hours were back having seen Wodehouse Pacha, who gave them an order for the Engineer of the Government works, who soon arrived and began patching us up for getting back to Assouan.  We had reluctantly abandoned the idea of getting up to Philae in the Herodotus, for even if this engineer could mend us securely, we felt that these Bedouins Page 49might take us from bad to worse and Jones, following Theodore’s instructions, had seen Cooks agent at Assouan, and had telegraphed to Cairo asking for one of the small Postal steamers that run from the 1st Cataract to Wady Halfa.  In 15 minutes after we had struck, every one of the dripping bronze savages had got into their clothes and picked up their belongings, and melted silently away over the rocks and islands, M.S. in his rage having actually flayed some of them off the boat - and we were left alone, anchored to the little island of rock and sand in the midst of the swirling river, which is here very wide and filled with rocks and islands, among which is rushes wildly, or spreads out in quiet stretches.  Of course we were in a rage of disappointment - at least Theodore, Nettie and I were - I don’t think I ever felt so wicked, and during the rest of the day we three moped about hardly speaking.  Nettie and I clambered up on some rocks, amongst some little acacia bushes, and sat down almost weeping.  Mrs. Davis and Howard however, had visibly brightened under the whole thing - for they had cherished I am sure many secret dreads and fears of danger and dervishes, to say nothing of the monotonous life on the dahabeah.  But there was certainly a charm in our unusual situation in that waste of waters, and as the afternoon waned, and the yellow cliffs came out in pink tints, and the shores began to darken into violet and purple, the silence was only broken by the rush of the rapids, and all night whenever I wakened there was the cold fresh air, and the soothing noise of rushing - and I could hardly sleep for enjoyment of it.  And so this morning we slipped quietly and ignominously back to Elephantine, and when we sat down to Page 50breakfast, we found ourselves looking out on the old familiar objects - even the chicken feathers left from our last slaughter of fowls, had not blown away from their place.  After we had finished breakfast we went over for a shopping in the bazaar.  I stayed at home during the afternoon, while Nettie and Howard walked on Elephantine to “grub” as they said - and brought home some curious little things - inscribed potsherds etc.  and reported that they had come across a human skeleton in their digging.  The rest went out in the felucca for a row.  Two or three quiet hours on the deck alone, under the awnings in the afternoon light, amongst these beautiful surroundings, is something to enjoy.  Theodore has made all the preparations for going to Wady Halfa in the little steamer Semneh, which leaves Shellal next Monday, and makes the trip there and back in a week.  It will be alas, a very different thing from going leisurely along in our own boat, independent of hours and seasons - but we will see Nubia - the great temple of Abu Simbel - and the upper river - Mr. Fielding will meet us here on our return, coming up from Cairo.Jan. 26.              We have had a lovely day at Philae once more - and I never thought to see it again!  Our hampers, and camp equipage and saddles had been sent across the river before breakfast.  Aside from our elaborate lunch which we always have on these expeditions M.S.  takes a folding table, chairs, rugs beside all the dishes.  After breakfast we crossed ourselves, and found our men and donkeys ready, and crossing Page 51the railway tracks we started out on that well remembered and fascinating desert route - climbing the hill, and through the wide, strange burying ground, into that famous road or track, which for centuries has been the high road from the South to the North - and whose travellers, kings, priests and generals have left their inscriptions on the rocks.  Since our last visit these have all been numbered in white paint, which gives rather an unpleasant sign boardy, ticketed museum like air; but it will soon be of great interest, for they have all been translated and will soon be published.  The rose coloured granite shows everywhere - glistening and rosy in the yellow sand - and the drifts of this golden yellow sand in the great rifts and hollows of the hills, are beautiful.  Then as we approached Philae we came upon those strange, fantastic, mammoth bowlders, rounded and worn and piled up upon one another in such wonderful fashion.  Strabo described them in his time.  On arriving at Philae, I soon saw “Yemma” my delightful little dragoman somewhat changed and grown, though I knew him at once, and although he seemed to know me, I did not believe he really did, until after a while he asked me to take my paper and pencil and write his picture, as I did before! Then I remembered that Mary made a sketch of him, and so he really knew, and had placed me.  He had all his pretty ways - that quaint care-taking manner, and sympathetic watchfulness - and he pulled at my heart strings all the time, just as he did two years ago.  Nettie was in raptures over Philae.  We found the Newmans as usual in the painted portico, and as usual, very nice - and they made us promise to go down to their boat the “Hapi” (Hapi being the God of the Nile) after Page 52luncheon.  The rest declined to climb down the steep bank and then up again, so Theodore and I went - found their boat charming, as well as themselves - and we stayed an unconscionable time.  I had never seen Mr. Newman’s pictures, and had never felt an interest in them - but we were much pleased with them and Theodore bought one, a view from the Philae colonnade, for the large sum I thought of £200.  Our donkeys had been sent round to the village of Mahatta, and we were rowed across, and then home through this village and Shellal and both typical Nubian villages, the former one before the trade with the Soudan was destroyed by the war, was a picturesque port, the caravans from the South lading and unlading there.  Miss Edwards even in her day, describes its attractions.  A fascinating ride that was in the late afternoon, through that strange scenery.  We have had strong West winds for 2 days.Jan. 27.              Home all day - very high wind - Theodore and Nettie had a delightful ramble on Elephantine - and in the afternoon all except myself rode out to the quarries, and then to the Barracks to see the Soudanese dance which goes on all day every Friday - I had another quiet afternoon on deck - I am ruining myself buying amber beads at the bazaar - and have been busy washing and restringing them.  The night being so brilliant, Nettie and Howard, with Jones and Mohammed went back to the barracks to see the dance by moonlight.  Our little cat Mish-mish, can hardly be recognized for the thin, timid, neglected Page 53cat we took on board at Cairo.  She is fat and big - and most self-reliant and daring - she goes to the top of the companion way, when she finds her saucer of milk on our deck empty, and yowls so to the cook below, that every one laughs, and Ali is sent up with a fresh supply.  She stays below in our quarters, or on our deck with us, and keeps all her toilet requisites under one of the divans.Jan. 28.              Another day at lovely Philae - rode over and found it excessively warm.  Yemma was waiting for me; he had told Mrs. Newman that his “Sitt” was coming from Assouan today.  There was another little fellow I had never before seen.  The most delicious little savage “Dehdowah”, not much bigger than his name, but so solid and square, with such big cheeks, and very big soft eyes - he was too delightful.  He attached himself to Howard Amory, and reached just about to his knee.  Like Yemma, he carried a fly whisk, and kept the flies off his chosen patron with great solemnity.  Such composure and self reliance I have never seen in a small person before.  There are a few families living over on the small and interesting island of Biggeh opposite Philae, and their little mud houses are clustered about what remains of a small temple.  The Newmans have them under their special protection it would seem - and these little people come from there, and pass backwards and forwards between it and Philae, quite independent of boats by rolling up their single little cotton garment on their heads and swimming across.  Mrs. Newman says Yemma’s Page 54family and kindred are quite exceptional savages - and I should think they might be.  She teaches them, sews for them, nurses them if they are ill, lectures them and is generally guardian saint to them - and as this is the fourth winter the Newmans have lain at Philae in their boat, she knows them well.  Yemma has acquired some new English words, I heard him say distinctly several times today to some of the other children, “shut up”.  We did not ride all the way home, but after another long visit to the Newmans, we took one of the Cataract boats, which are large rowboats with comfortable cushioned seats, and a sail, and some dozen men to row, and went back as far as the big cataract, which some of the Bedouins swim down for the pleasure of the tourists, and a small baksheesh.  I had seen the thing before, and did not enjoy the sight of the shivering, dripping men as they came out of the water well enough to wish to see it again.  So the rest went off leaving me with one boatman.  It was a delicious half hour - the waning light of the afternoon - the quiet, broken only by the rushing water, that strange scenery and wide desolation.  As soon as the others got out of sight, my boatman got out, washed himself - spread his outer cotton dress on the sand, and began his devotions.  It was a sight much better worth the seeing than the one the others had gone to see.  One can never say too much or think, or see too much of this wonderful rock scenery of the Cataract, such strange polished and rounded rocks, worn by the action of water into such fantastic shapes, the water having left a black deposit of iron on them, so that they look like mammoth castings - and then these ancient hieroglyphs on the still more ancient Page 55rocks! Home by Mahatta as before.Jan. 29.  Septuagesima Sunday.              A very quiet day.  I have done a little reading and getting ready for leaving tomorrow morning - sailed across the river in the afternoon, and walked through the bazaar quite to the end of the town - the hills and palms a pretty sight.  I am immensely sorry we do not take Jones or Mohammed with us tomorrow.  Cook has been so very unaccommodating, and declares that, as there is a dragoman on the steamer, he will charge £10 extra for Mohammed, and the same for Jones - Theodore pays the enormous sum of £180 for the boat, not including baksheesh and it seems most unreasonable, there being only 5 of us, we cannot take the two men, without this extra charge.Jan. 30th.              We left Assouan at 9 o’clock this morning in the train for Shellal.  Most of our crew went across the river with us, and waited until the little train started - giving us dozens of farewells - Jones, Mohammed and Abbocatto and Hanna Ibram our cook, went to Shellal with us, and spent the day at Philae.  There were many of Cooks tourists in the train, for 2 steamers beside our own were going - and after that short brotherhood were very glad we were to be by ourselves.  We lay at the bank sometime getting in our stores, and had time to examine our quarters and settle ourselves.  It was not very encouraging though everything was clean.  Our staterooms open on the outside deck,              Page 56and are fairly comfortable with one person in each - but I dread to think what they would be crowded with miscellaneous people - for all the 8 rooms hold 2, 3, or 4 people.  There is no sitting room.  The little dining room just over the wheel at the stern is a comfortless appartment, and so very joggly with the motion of the wheel, that we are obliged to have the engine slowed when we are eating.  The sailing out from Philae was beautiful - we got off at 11 o’clock.  Soon the river broadened, the scenery became less wild, the cliffs fell away on either hand - on the West, the yellow Libyan desert quite to the water, and but a bit of a strip of verdure on the EaSt. At Kertassi we see the ruins of a small temple, with a few columns and one architrave remaining in place - then Tafeh, and some more ruins.  Then we passed through Bab-el-Kalabshi, a solemn gloomy gorge of the river, with black rocks and islets, and bends and shallows, on one of the islands, large brick ruins - then Kalabshi and its temple, which with the smaller one of Bet el-Walli we intend seeing on our way down.  All the afternoon I was on the little deck outside my room, with my opera glass and book - enjoying the beautiful stretches of the river, so unlike the lower Nile - the villages not so frequent, but of better type - many of the houses with arched roofs, and some of them looking almost like forts, with large enclosing outside walls for protection ; passed some splendid sycamores - the true Plantamus Occidentalis, being a native of Egypt.  Stopped at 7 o’clock P.M. at Dendûr, having made 50 miles.  A Mr. Fowler came on board from the other steamer “Oonas” lying close by, and spent the evening - an Englishman, to whom Theodore Page 57had been introduced this morning - very agreeable - and had wide political knowledge, and we discussed Egyptian affairs - of which he knew a great deal.  Every one is reading Milner, which we have brought along, I not having finished it - Theodore has read it.  The night is superb - we have passed the Tropic of Cancer.  A cold wind all day.Jan. 31.              I was awakened by the start this morning at 4 o’clock - slept again, and wakened at 7.  This little boat rackets about so, under the working of her engine, that I was almost rattled out of bed.  I found we were stopping at Dakkeh - where is a ruined Ptolemaic temple built on the site of an ancient one of the Middle period.  It was opposite here that an important stele was found describing the route to the gold mines of Wadi Kaki, of the 3d year of Ramses II.  Passengers of the Oonas stopped here to visit the temple, but having stopped ourselves to take on the manager, we kept on, preferring to give our time more leisurely to the best things.  It seems these 3 boats are run with but one dragoman, and a person they call the Manager, whose head quarters are on our boat.  Yesterday, we had no one on board speaking English but the Engineer, who is English - and the 3 young Arab servants are particularly helpless and ineffective; so we were very glad to have this manager, who speaks English almost perfectly.  He is a Syrian by birth, with an English mother - and is most attentive to us.  The desert now comes down almost to the river on both sides - and we wonder what the poor people live on in this part of Nubia.  The occasional strip of Page 58arable land, has splendid palms - and they are treated with the greatest care - most of them in little encircling mud walls of their own and the sakkiehs are very close together and worked constantly.  The villages look indescribably dreary, perched on the desert slopes of the hills, for arable land is too precious here for human habitations, and we could scarcely descry them at times without the glass, so entirely were they the colour of the mountains and desert.  How hot and dreary they did look in the merciless glare of the sun - not a green thing about them, and the few people sitting under the shadow of the walls, or moving about looking like large black flies.  The river is lonely - no boats - no life on it - deep, with no sand banks.  We pass Sabûrah at lunch time, and rush out to see it, lying shrowded in a golden sand drift - with only the pylons to be seen, two sphynxes, and two statues of Rameses II standing before them; who built this temple and dedicated it to Ammon and Ptah.  It is on the walls of the court of this temple, that a procession of the children of Rameses II appear - each with his name.  If this list is correct, this great Rameses must have been quite the father of a family, for it accords him 111 sons and 67 daughters!  This temple is worth seeing, but we are going to stop to do that when we come down.  The afternoon was very warm and still - and we sat on the little upper deck, delighted with the beautiful scenery.  Occasionally great rocky detached peaks rising from the desert, and desert desolation everywhere.  We reached Korosko about 5 o’clock.  Korosko has always seemed to me for some reason very interesting and African, and at the very verge of civilization.  I suppose because I have read of Page 59travellers to the interior starting from Korosko for the long ride to Abu Hamad across the desert, avoiding in this way the three upper cataracts.  It has lost almost entirely its former importance in this way - for no caravans arrive and depart now.  There is a large garrison here, and we walked about it, finding it most interesting - the soldiers’ quarters especially built in the midst of a palm forest - the officers’ quarters very attractive - and I was quite touched by a little carefully tended flower garden, with familiar European and English flowers in it, looking very dejected and homesick I must say.  There was the most wonderful effect of sunset flush and moonlight as we walked back to the boat.  Started again, and made Amada by 8 o’clock.  Theodore, Nettie and Howard with the Manager went up to see the temple by moonlight.  It is well worth seeing, being an excellent example of the architecture of the 18th dynasty.Feb. 1st.              We started at 4 A.M. and made Abu Simbel by one o’clock, - 51 miles.  We passed Derr before I was  dressed and Ibrim, and further on Kasr-Ibrim, where there is a large ruined Roman fortress - then Toski, near which place on Aug.  3, 1889 the British army under Gen.  Grenfell and Col.  Wodehouse, defeated a large force of Dervishes, led by Wad el-Nejumi, one of the Mahdi’s most valiant chieftains.  It was he who conquered Hicks, and let the final attack on Khartoum, and might have proved a dangerous enemy to Egypt.  Near Ibrim the land near the river was green with palms - and the sakkiehs were busy - but elsewhere Page 60and expecially as we approached Abu Simbel the country seemed utterly desert and uninhabited, and the houses in the occasional villages looked like rude fortresses with pylon like structures.  We sat on the deck, watching with our glasses for the first glimpse of the Abu Simbel figures - at last I began to make them out, but they had a most unexpected look to me, familiar as I was with them through photographs.  We drew near rapidly, slowing up as we passed the beautiful façade of the other rock temple of Queen Nefertari - and were then almost under the Colossi of the great temple.  It was one o’clock when we stopped, and we had made a run of 51-1/2 miles.  We had lunch with the doors of the little cabin open and the natives were beginning to collect on the bank much interested in our doings.  We were congratulating ourselves as we got off, that we were so much in advance of the other boats.  There is only a narrow path in the sand, at the foot of the cliffs - and as we stood on deck we seemed almost able to touch the rocks.  We climbed around the steep bank, and across the foot of the great drift of golden sand, which has blown across the desert behind the mountain, and overflowed in one enormous sheer unbroken line  almost to the waters edge - quite cutting off one corner of the façade.  They are truly stupendous things these Colossi, and the longer I sat and looked at them, the more fascinating they grew.  We stayed a long time staring up at them from every angle, and a still longer time inside - only coming out when the people from the other boats began climbing up.  I sat a long time on the tomb of the English officer buried there - and tried to forget the wretched fellaheen who Page 61were crowding about with their wretched beads etc. for sale - and I was amused to see in the crowd of tourists who came up from the other boats, a large proportion of them more interested in these things than in the temple, and spending large part of their short allotted time with them.  But what a place in which to be buried! such views up and down the great stretches of the river - the vast desolation and silence of the desert everywhere, and the four seated Colossi smiling in eternal watchfulness, over all! Then we climbed down, and went along the little rocky path to the smaller temple, which we found delightfully interesting.  I think the faces and forms of the Queen and of Isis on several parts of the temple walls, the most beautiful things I have ever seen in Egyptian art.  After a most lovely sunset and dinner we went up in the moonlight to the great temple again - the clamoring natives had all gone home, the other boats had gone, and the silence, and the moonlight on those great stony countenances, was splendidly solemn.  The night is cold - and the wind strong, and we are to be called tomorrow at 3 o’clock to see the Southern Cross - all but Theodore, who declines to be awakened.  Feb.  2d.              It seemed to me this morning when one of the men knocked at my door to tell me it was half past 3 o’clock, that I had not been asleep more than half an hour.  I climbed down from my bed very quietly and pushed open my window which fortunately opened to the east, and looked out for the Great Cross - Nettie and Howard and the Manager Page 62were just outside, and were talking to Theodore who had his head out of his window.  They pointed out the Cross, which is seen here much foreshortened and as it were in perspective, and is somewhat disappointing.  Then I closed my window for the morning was very cold, and climbed again into my high, narrow little bed, intending to get up at dawn, and see the Colossi emerge from the gloom of the night.  It was hardly more than 5 o’clock when I again got up and opened my window and looked out upon one of the most beautiful spectacles I ever saw.  It was quite dark except in the East, where a soft crimson color was beginning to stir, and just above which a splendid planet shone and shot its silvery light across the placid water, quite to the boat.  I hope I never may forget that lovely sight!  We were soon all but Theodore, on the upper deck shivering in the chill morning air, and just as the light began to break across those four great faces, we saw our steersman climb into his wheel house, the engine began to work, and we were off for Wady Halfa, which we reached at 12:30 making 40 miles.  The country from Abu Simbel to Wady Halfa is undescribably desert, and very grand in its desolation - great detached mountain slopes, evidently the remains of former ranges, but worn and separated by water action, their tops, snowed over as it were, with a blackish deposit, some specimens of which I got - looking like klinkers from a furnace - or small black stalactites - everywhere were the splendid rifts of orange golden sand - to me one of the most beautiful features of the Upper Nile.  We passed the ruins of a Saracen fortress, then the strange tumuli that Miss Edwards describes, one of which they opened, as far as their imPage 63plements would allow.  Wady Halfa looked very pretty as we passed near the fort.  Mohammed had given me some presents for his people - one of the long thick woolen wraps that the better class wear, black, with a little embroidery at the edges, and one of the wide, long black scarfs for his uncle - also £1 for him.  For his wife 2 pairs of really handsome silver bracelets, and £2, and another black shawl for his cousin Suleyman Ali Kara.  The Salah family are quite people of importance in that part of Nubia.  Mohammed had telegraphed his uncle to meet us on the arrival of the steamer, and arrange for taking us out to his place.  He proved a most venerable looking old man, with brown face and white beard, surmounted by a voluminous white turban, and with flowing garments of soft white wool - and an excellent manner - he had with him Suleyman Ali Kara a handsome fellow with his black curling moustache under his white turban.  They came back in the afternoon with donkeys for us.  We had asked through an interpretation of the manager, in the morning how far the Salah place might be - if it was in walking distance, and the answer was about half an hour - so knowing the uncertainty of their time limits, we had gratefully accepted their offers of donkeys - and very glad we were, for after passing the fort, we rode 2 miles into the desert, coming at last to a large fort like enclosure, a high wall surrounding a large enclosure - with only one opening - a large entrance door, with seats on either side of it against the wall, where a lot of men were waiting to receive us - a forest of palms lying between it and the river.  We went into a court from which opened the houses of various members of the family - and were conducted to the Page 64state appartments or habitation - where, in one corner of the court, entirely open on one side we were asked to sit down.  There was a raised dais like place across one end of the room - and above this were hanging some embroidered saddle cloths and things.  The rest of the appartment was covered with nice rugs, and cushioned divans and chairs, and a low table set out with very pretty china - and we were immediately served with coffee, and large soup plates full of popped corn, with piles of dates in the middle.  Then we asked to see Mohammed’s Mother, and his new wife, to whom he had been married since we were here last, his first wife and child being dead - and they came in to see us.  So long as Theodore and Howard stayed, they would not uncover their faces, but when they went away to see something else, we persuaded them to take off their veils.  The mother was a clean looking old woman - but the wife was lovely - tall and slim with brown oval face - the softest eyes - the whitest teeth - and very engaging gentle ways.  I was a little shocked to see her hair in the tiny Nubian braids which are so ugly.  She is the cousin of Mohammed - being the daughter of the old stately white haired man - who was formerly a person of wealth and slaves and possessions - owning a large fertile island in the river some miles south of Wady Halfa - but the Dervishes descended upon that part of the country a few years ago, and destroyed everything.  Many members of his family were killed - all his brothers - and he and his daughter are now dependent on Mohammedan’s generosity.  I gave the mother and wife the gifts Mohammed had sent, which I had wrapped in colored papers and tied with ribbons - and then we five women talked Page 65as well as we could - we being totally ignorant of their language as they of ours, - we laughed a great deal - and showed them our rings and watches.  I think they were more amused with my lorgnette than anything else.  Then we told each others names - the tall, pretty young wife is named Iamai.  Then we went into the other part of the court to see some of the other women - fine, clean looking women they all were - and from every door emerged heads of children and women, who no doubt were as curious about us, as we were about them.  Then we said an elaborate goodbye - and the old man and Suleyman brought us home - and the ride across the desert in the evening light was very pleasant with the remembrance of that patriarchal family scene behind us.  Having said goodbye to our kind hosts, and presented the gifts of Mohammed and declined a sheep in return, we took a walk about the garrison, looking so pretty under its palm trees - it is of very large extent - covering more than a mile, I should think - in admirable order - and the quarters of the officers, especially of the Commanding officer, Wodehouse Pacha, looked delightfully pleasant on the bank of the river, embowered in vines and shrubberies - the bougainvillia in full magenta bloom.  Theodore was invited to spend the evening with Wodehouse Pacha, and is now up there.  I brought along Milners book on England and Egypt to read - which I find doubly interesting in these scenes.  We have been having a great many little jokes on our way up about falling into the hands of dervishes.  Our nice looking black Reis, has been under fire more than once on the river and our jolly looking English engineer has also seen service on the river during the war - and is quite interesting.  I must Page 66say that I have felt it reassuring when we have been tied up to these desolate shores at night, to reflect that an English gun boat was near.  It is very cold tonight with a strong north wind - and it has been cold for 2 days - and we have been eating our meals in our comfortless little stern dining room with our hats and coats on - and sit about in the evening done up in all our rugs and wraps.  It is certainly what I had not expected of the Tropic of Cancer, on so near an acquaintance.Feb. 3d.              This morning we took a long walk through the garrison and home by the river bank - everything was in perfect order and beautifully clean - the black, black Soudanese soldiers - as well as the yellow Egyptian soldiers had such a good air of training and discipline - the Egyptian officers were very smart.  The low, whitewashed buildings, with the yellow desert on one side, and palm groves and the river on the other - the sun intensely bright and hot, and the wind strong and cold - I am always reminded of the man in the fable, in the race between the wind and the sun, in this country.  Last night the thermometer went down to 44°.  Since the last dervish raids, tourists are not allowed as formerly to go out several miles beyond the fort, to see the 2d cataract from the top of Abousir.  I should like to have seen it, and especially looked down the road, along which poor, brave, deluded Gordon started on his way to Khartoum.  We spent the rest of the morning until 11 o’clock wandering about and looking over Wodehouse Pacha’s queer boat - then started at 11 o’clock - and reached Abu Sim             Page 67bel at 2 o’clock.  We found the same group of hopeless natives assembled on shore - the deaf and dumb man, with his prolific smiles, and gestures, making the same hideous noises, to show that he was a worthy recipient of charity and baksheesh, the same woman with the silver bracelets and earrings for sale, and all the rest of the clamouring crowding people with their beads and “antikas”.  We had a delightful hour or more at the big temple before the Oonah and Ankeh arrived, and their people came climbing up through the sand.  Our little Hassan the kindest and nicest of attendants had brought out 2 soda bottles, and filled them for me, and filled them with the lovely, tawny sand near the door of the temple - and just here, peeping out from its yellow sand shrowd is the top of a beautiful portal - we could not resist trying to dig it out a little - but the drift is so steep in incline, and so enormous in weight, that it poured down again like a pink golden rain.  If I were very, very rich, I would bring a great army of work people, and under the best engineering skill that could be had, I would have that mountain of sand dug away, and the never failing supply from above diverted and this splendid rock temple laid entirely bare.  We got away at 5:30, straining our eyes to the last moment to see those great smiling faces - we are now 9:30 at Ibrim, having made 80 miles today.  The wind has been so cold and strong, that we could not half enjoy the beautiful colour effects on the mountains.  We have stayed in our little cabins wrapped in our rugs and cloaks.  I have finished Milner - a timely and immensely interesting book - and one that must have great political effect.Page 68Feb. 4th.              Got away from Ibrim at 7:30 A.M, the day has been cold and cloudy - and I was in my room most of the time reading - I wanted to land and visit the temple of Amade, but no one else seemed inclined to do it, and so we passed on.  Reached Korosko at 11 o’clock and left at 1:30.  The rest went on shore, and again visited the garrison - as did also the French people from the dahabeah Teheran, which we found lying here - and they were all asked into the Colonel’s quarters and given coffee - and shown about - and a special camel drill improvised for them - and they brought back to the steamer, a very smart Egyptian Captain who spoke English very well, though some of his expressions were unusual and amusing.  For instance, speaking of the wild fighting and excitement of the black soldiers under fire, and the difficulty of restraining them, he said, touching his head significantly “a man wants to have all his wise, when he goes into battle”.  We passed Suburah late in the afternoon, and as the river on that side was very shallow requiring a small boat, and the Semneh carried none, we very reluctantly passed that by.  Tonight we are lying at Dakkeh, very glad indeed that it is our last night on this wretched little boat.  How different Nubia, and the Upper Nile, and everything would have been, if we had been loitering along in the Herodotus, coming in for a thousand impressions and experiences that we could never get on a steamer, I can faintly imagine.  But now that the first disappointment has worn off, I feel that we could ill have spent the time, for it would have taken a month or more, and the river is falling rapidly, and there is always              Page 69the chance of there not being sufficient water to get a boat down the Cataract.  All the same, Nubia would have been a very different thing.Feb. 5th.  Sexagisima Sunday.              We left Dakkeh at 4:30, and when I came out of my room before breakfast, we were lying just under the temple of Kalabahi, with a row of natives on the bank, dangling strings of beads, and brushes of feathers, and barbaric arms, and chickens and pigeons - and patiently waiting until we should become their prey - and when after breakfast we did climb the bank, we came in for a fine clamour.  I never saw so many beads - all of them barbaric.  The temple is Ptolemaic - greatly in ruins, and hardly worth a visit - and we were back in the boat and off for Shellal as soon as we could, which we reached at 1 o’clock P.M. - having made 63 miles.  As soon as we drew up, we discerned across at Philae, Mohammed and then Jones and Mr. Fielding, who had arrived at Assouan the night before - and they were soon with us.  Mr. Fielding under a large white Chinese hat, quite like a huge extinguisher he having after his voyage with Lord Braye, around the world, left him at Cairo, and come up the river to join us.  Mr. Newman had also sent his felucca with his men, and the picture Theodore had bought - and that with all our traps was piled on a camel, and sent across to Assouan then there was a great settling of backsheeshs, and saying goodbye - and we got into one of the Cataract boats and went across to see the Newmans, who were just starting for an afternoon on Biggeh, and begged us as we had never been there, to join them, so leaving Nettie and Field             Page 70ing at Philae, we went, and in spite of the heat, were repaid; for the little island is extraordinary - its shores piled high with the strange rounded black rocks, leaving a little desert in the center where a few palm trees grow - under which stood 2 or 3 columns of a ruined temple, around which are the little huts of Yemma’s family - I saw the little fellow for the last time and said goodbye, and we all set off in our Cataract boat to make the descent of the Cataract, which is very exciting - such a wild swirl of waters, through which the crew labor with their oars - we were soon approaching the Herodotus, where our Rais and all the smiling brown faces of our crew, were waiting to receive us - and how charming and luxurious and even vast the interior seemed! A huge mail of letters and papers we found and our little Mish-mish went into a whirl of delighted play with me.  Feb. 6th.              Jones tells us that a caravan of 40 camels laden with gum came into Assouan one day last week from Berber, having come that distance in 60 days.  He said Mohammed went out beyond the barracks, where they were encamped on the edge of the desert, to see them.  We saw some of the men when we went into the bazaar this morning - a row of great, swarthy men squatting outside one of the native cafés - how their eyes did flash and how they showed their white teeth, and how they looked exactly as if they had come out of the “Arabian Nights”.  Home all the afternoon.Page 71Feb. 7th.              We went over to Assouan this morning - and as Mr. Fielding had never seen the schools here, we went first to the Government School and then to the American Mission School - I had been telling him that these Mission schools were too narrow in their teachings and of too distinctly a religious type - and although their influence has been great, it has been confined entirely to the Copts and the children of foreigners - we found the Gov.  school in quite a large building with an inside court for recreation, and with the school rooms arranged about it, all very clean and in perfect order.  Milner, in his “England in Egypt” says that the advance in education reform has been very great in the last 3 years.  The old teaching of the Koran, and the exclusion of every thing in the way of science and literature that was not of Arabic origin necessarily limited educational results, until the deficiency was keenly realized by the public.  Under the general progress in all things which has taken place under the fostering English influence, this matter of education has made such steady strides, that now there are 42 government schools - 6 primary ones of lower grade - 34 of higher grade, and 2 Secondary schools which are at Cairo.  These schools as to management and method are under the best modern influences, and either French or English as is wished by the pupils, is taught.  The old teaching of the Ulamas, who are really the priests and prophets of the great El Azhar at Cairo, is now a thing of the past.  All of this seems to me one of the greatest of revolutions, and must bring the evident results in progress and modern civilization              Page 72one of which must be that Moslemism must undergo a reformation, as being distinctly alien to modern thought and progress - or else take its place amongst the dead faiths of the world.  Well -- on this occasion we went into the English class room of the lowest grade, where were some 40 boys of from 10 - 14 years of age I should think.  The room was bright, with fine maps, drawings for object lessons, blackboards etc. on the walls - the boys seated on the usual school forms, with desks before them - making the greatest possible contrast to the ordinary native schools I had seen, where the children had been seated on the ground swaying their bodies about in a senseless repetition of the Koran.  All of these boys were clean in person and dress - some of them were put through recitations and readings, and their copy books were shown, with really beautiful and legible writing, and I thought they contrasted more than favorably with the books of a like American class of boys - and the wonder was that these Mohammedan boys had been studying English not quite 4 months!  Their recitations were very amusing - two of them, one after another, repeated the little child’s poem so well known to American children, “Little sheep, pray tell me why, in the pleasant fields you lie” - the h taking the sound of z in most cases.  It seemed to me one of the most promising school rooms I had ever seen, and when we walked a few minutes after into the single large, dirty, and disorderly school room of the American Mission, where some of the ill assorted scholars of the 1st class, the brightest being a Copt boy of 12, and the dullest a big, shuffling jet black negro of 20 or more years, read in their turn verse by verse, a part of one of Page 73the most uninstructive chapters of the new Testament, the contrast was very great.  The American Mission School has undoubtedly done its best work in this country - when before the reformation in the Gov.  schools they educated to a certain degree, a restricted class.  Though their wish and aim from the first has been a missionary one to prosylites, they confessed to us at the American College in Assiout when we were here before, that they were never successful, as a Moslem changed into a Christian is almost unknown.  We afterwards went to the bazaar, where we spent the rest of the morning.  In the afternoon Mrs. Davis and Fielding went over to Philae, and back by a cataract boat.  The rest of us took our felucca with sail, about 4 o’clock, and sailed up towards the Cataract - the wind quite failed - but the evening was very lovely - with strange cloud effects - and a few rain drops fell - the day has been very warm - we are waiting for a good south wind to start down the river.  Mr. Peto came up in his little dahabeah, the Camile yesterday, and is just behind us.Feb. 8th.              A strong north wind blowing this morning we thought it not worthwhile attempting to move.  It was cold, and Nettie and I went out to walk up and down the sand bank in the sun.  Mr. Peto came to meet us and ask us to go and have a look at his little boat, and see his monkey - Jocko proved quite delightful, the prettiest monkey I ever saw - quite small, with a great deal of soft brown hair, and very gentle ways.  The Camile was a most artistic little boat - outside and in - Page 74Mr. Peto is entirely alone, and has things all his own way - he is an architect, very well known I believe in London - very artistic and aesthetic.  The cabin was all in white paint with dark blue and pale green furnishings - Cairo pottery - blue bead mummy decorations etc.  etc.  Then he brought Jocko over to our boat to introduce him to the cat, Jocko making not the slightest show of attention, but poor Mish-mish going into shivers of rage of the sight of him.  Then we all crossed the river, walking through the bazaar to the end of the town, and blinded by the clouds of dust blown into our faces from every quarter - it is quite cool.  We hope to get off tomorrow - I saw a black tall straight Soudanese woman walking along the edge of the town, black as night, with her silver ornaments - and white robes, with red stripes at the edges - how capable, and strong and quiet she looked.Feb. 9th.              The north wind was again wildly disporting itself as we looked out on the river this morning, which was a ghastly brown color, and we moped about until just after luncheon, when there came as we thought a final lull, and we began our preparations for sailing - and had pulled out into the middle of the river, when it burst out again with redoubled fury, and it was with some difficulty that avoiding the rocks, we could bring up to the shore at Assouan just under the hotel.  The clouds grew blacker and the rain began and lasted until 5 o’clock, when having let up a little Theodore proposed going up into the bazaar and buying some thin curtains for the cabin windows - which we have Page 75been intending to do all the way up.  So we set off in a hurry, and found most of the shops closed - however we succeeded in getting some of the very cheap and pretty manchester cotton which is made for the Soudanese women - a kind of soft cheese cloth, with thick borders of red and green.  Then we took a last long walk beyond the bazaar towards the barracks, and home by the river path - past the Dispensary, and the clean attractive looking grain markets, and so back to our boat.  Mr. Wilbur came over and made us a long visit this evening - and the talk was all of Egypt and Egyptian things.  The thermometer has been 54° all day.Feb. 10th.              It rained softly, but steadily most of the night, and I laid in bed this morning after the shutters had been opened, looking up to the dripping bank, and the hotel above, and the few miserable figures in their thin cotton clothes, coming and going along the path in front of the hotel.  Rain seems so incongruous in this country - all its attributes in the way of umbrellas and overshoes etc.  being entirely unknown here - and the flowing cotton gowns looking so inadequate and inappropriate.  It is cold - 58° - and it has rained hard at intervals all day.  We have been sitting about writing and making our curtains.Feb. 11.              It cleared last night a little - but the morning was cold and threatening - almost a snow sky - our wet and bedraggled decks with the              Page 76furniture heaped about and covered with rugs and canvas, was dismal enough as we stood about watching the getting off, a crowd of natives on the bank watching us - among them our friend of the India shop, who looked quite sad.  We moved off slowly - slipping by one after another well known landmark - how sad it is to let these things go for what is probably the last time.  We get off about 10 o’clock, and floating and rowing we made until we pulled up for the night, about 15 miles.  I devoted the day to writing letters.Feb. 12.  Quinquagesima Sunday.              A clear fine day at last - started about 7 and made Kom Ombo at 2 o’clock.  Crowds of workmen were busy at excavating, and the dust of their labours ascended to heaven.  We landed a little distance below the temple, and started to walk - but the cold wind was blowing hard, and Theodore suffering from a bad cold, I persuaded him to turn back with me.  We were very glad, as the others stayed but a short time not being allowed to enter the temple, and being choked to death by the duSt. At 5 o’clock we left and went on until after 6 o’clock, when we stopped for the night having made in spite of the strong north wind 15 miles.Feb.13.              We have been virtually laid up today - making 3 miles by 10 o’clock when we laid up before a strong gale from the north.  I had a little walk on the shore in the afternoon.  Theodore who has a cold, had been Page 77playing chess with Mr. Fielding most of the day - with a lamp lighted to bring up the temperature in his room.  We have been reading a horribly fascinating book - Major Wingate’s narrative of the story told him by the Missionary German priest, Father Obewalder, of his imprisonment 10 years ago with 7 men by the Malidi - and his escape with the two men remaining alive, some months ago.  It is the most awful tale of wild cruelty and bloodshed and adventure ever read - and must precipitate public feeling toward English occupation of Egypt - I am sure if we had read these blood curdling tales of Dervish cruelty before we went to Wady Halfa, our courage would have failed us.Feb. 14th.              We started early this morning reaching Begel Silsileh soon after breakfast, in spite of the strong head wind.  There the Nile is immensely interesting - the mountain chains on either side coming close together - and the special worship of the river at this point is supposed to date from a time when the gorge of the river was narrower than it now is, and the passage difficult.  The rock chapels and inscribed tablets lie on the western bank, where we landed - and climbed about over the rocky paths and waded through the sand, and visited them all.  The rock chapel of Horus, and speos of Rameses II and Merenptah 1st.  Lovely things they must have been with their bright colors and beautiful papyrus bud columns at the facades.  The Horus speos looked even more ruinous than it did when we were here 2 years ago.  The beautiful Isis with the infant Horus, and all the triumphal scene of King Horus returning from the miserable land of Kush, are delightful - and I re             Page 78cognized again with pleasure the gentleman with the coachman’s capes! A Hymn to the Nile, lofty and inspired in style is given in the inscriptions on this west bank - the translation of which is worth reading in the different books.  How strange the river must have looked in those days, with the rich colours and carvings on the rocks - and the strange little recesses, with their sitting figures always reminding me of what Miss Edwards said of them, that they looked like owners in their opera boxes.  The wind having fallen very much, and Theodore in a hurry to get on, we did not cross to the east side to see the important and impressive quarries which we visited before - and the lesser ones on the west side give an inadequate idea of what they are - immense avenues cut through the sandstone rock, as clean and straight as possible for 50 and 60 feet - with the wedge openings plainly visible.  Miss Edwards description of these is wonderful.  We got away at lunch time, and are now half way to Edfou, having made 22 miles.Feb. 15.                Started at 7 this morning, reached Edfou at 9 o’clock, and went off immediately after breakfast to the temple.  How perfect and interesting it is - one can in imagination see the strange and solemn services that once filled this great temple with their splendor and ceremony.  Nettie and I with Mr. Fielding and Howard escorted by Jones and our men, climbed to the top of the great pylon, and got a wonderful view of the country, which is beautiful here, the valley being wide and highly cultivated.  But the strangest sight was the village that              Page 79lay spread out below and around us! It was much like looking into a great wasp’s nest, or busy ant hill.  We left Nettie, Mr. Fielding and Howard at the little American Mission school that Mr. Fielding wanted to see, and the rest of us rode home through the narrow, rather clean streets of the town, across the canal bridge, and through the pleasant fields back to the boat.  I was much amused at the description Howard gave me of the visit to the school - afterward confirmed by Nettie with greater detail.  It seems school hours were over, but two or three scholars lingering about, the school master wished to show their English and begging them not to dismount, called the boys and made them read a portion of the old Testament choosing or falling upon a very uninstructive chapter, which as Howard said “was not above deck”.  Our poor victims sat through it as long as they could, and then broke away.  We left Edfou while we were lunching and are now at El Kab, 13-1/2 miles from Edfou - making the days run 25-1/2 miles.  The evening is radiantly beautiful - and the “Kitty” is lying just in front of us - deserted except by her Captain and one or two men - Mr. Tylor and Somers-Clarke being up on the mountain where we are going to see them tomorrow.Feb. 16th.              Immediately after breakfast we took some very wretched little donkeys, and rode out to the mountains to see the tombs, and to see Mr. Tylor and his friend who are encamped there making drawings and excavations.  A lot of workmen were making a great deal of dust as we climbed the path and surprised Mr. Tylor in the midst of them.  We had never seen Page 80El Kab before, and were delighted.  These tombs date from the last of the Hyksos, or soon after their rule - and were built by members of a noble family and show the same picture of ancient domestic life that the Beni Hassan and Sakkarah tombs do - the same “Threshing Song” or “Song of the Oxen” appears here too.  We climbed from one to another, under convey of Mr. Tylor and then went to the tomb he temporarily occupies, quite a comfortable large rock tomb, with a good high ceiling - the shaft at the back of this appartment, which leads down to the real tomb was well covered with boards, and disguised with mattings and luggage - a comfortable camp bed, one or two chairs - a table, a lot of shelves rigged up - books, photographs etc.  made it look quite homelike - the door was protected by a mosquito netting, and an inside curtain - revolvers and rifle near the bed - a tub and washing things.  The large table was covered with drawing and photographing things - and Mr. Tylor showed us the beautiful reproductions he was making of the sculptures and inscriptions - a combined process of photography and pencil drawing most interesting and exquisite.  He gave us coffee, and to me a little vase and cup, such as he finds in the tombs he excavates.  The tomb next to this is used as a kitchen - and the one next to that by Mr. Somers-Clarke and was, as Mr. Tylor said quite “swagger”.  Near this, almost slipping down the mountain side, was a little tent, used as a dining room.  Mr. S.-C.  was off at the temple of Amenophis, of which he is making drawings - so we did not see him.  The view from this ledge of tombs is wide and beautiful.  Mr. Tylor says they find this life charming - the climate so fine, and the tombs quite warm at night - and cool Page 81during the heat of the day.  Mr. Fielding and Howard with Jones, rode on to the temple an hour away and saw Mr. Somers-Clarke - but we returned to explore the ancient fortress or walled town, which is very curious.  The walls are still in very good preservation and tremendously thick, being indeed 37 feet in thickness - made of large mud bricks - it encloses a square of which the sides are over 700 ft.  in length.  It was filled with such delightful looking heaps of rubbish, that Nettie and I were anxious to do a little grubbing, but the heat of the sun was intense - and we were thankful to reach the shelter and cleanliness of the dahabeah.  We were off at a little past one o’clock and reached Esneh, where we are now lying at 9 o’clock - 17-1/2 miles, the men having rowed hard to make it as there was no wind until 5 o’clock when a light one came to our relief.  Here we must stay until day after tomorrow to bake bread.Feb. 17th.       Esneh.              We are lying in a very pleasant place, quite away from the noisy part of the landing, and under the shade of some fine lebbek trees - and very near what used to be a palace of Mehemet Ali, in a large walled garden - with beautiful trees and shrubberies.  It is now one of the Government schools.  When we all walked into the town this morning on our way to the temple (which is Ptolemaic, and though of noble proportions and very interesting - being in fact only a hypostyle built by one of the Ptolemies to a temple of the 18 dynasty which now lies under the modern town, and has never been excavated, and to Page 82which you have to descend by a long steep flight of wooden stairs) we were accosted by two or three Egyptian boys, and a young Capt. of 20 or 22 years, very well dressed, and with good manners; they apologized for speaking and said in very bookish language, that they took every opportunity of speaking English with travellers, to improve their own English.  They went everywhere with us, and said they were scholars at the Gov.  school near us.  We invited them to come to the dahabeah for afternoon tea.  Soon after lunch Nettie and I went up to the school, and finding the Master walking in scholarly fashion under the trees conning a book, we asked if we could see the school - he said school hours were over, but he would be glad to show us the building.  It was a vasty old place, with some attempt at oriental magnificence, which years have rendered very shabby.  We were shown the old baths, which with their inlaid marbles must once have been very fine - but about which an evil smell now clings.  The rooms were full of good forms - blackboards - excellent object lessons - books etc.  and the Master spoke good English which he had learned at Miss Whately’s school at Cairo.  Soon after we got home the boys arrived - very shy but interested in everything - we had quite an elaborate tea - they at first declined anything, and then accepted everything.  We afterwards brought them down stairs, and showed them the boat, and photographs and Nettie and Mr. Fielding sang and played for them.  They seemed quite happy and were full of thanks, and gave us their names and addresses, and we gave them ours, promising to send them some English books and papers.  Page 83Feb. 18.              Another day of strong head wind - we started at 7 o’clock this morning and floating and rowing have made only 6 miles.  We tied up early in the afternoon, and Theodore, Howard and Jones and Mohammed Salah, took their guns and went ashore and Nettie and I with Mr. Fielding and some of the men went for a walk along the high bank above the dry bed of one of the irrigating canals.  It was pleasant to overlook so pleasant a country - blossoming crops - and wide stretches of the greenest wheat and barley - the latter almost in full head.  Here and there under the protection of walls of dry corn and dhourra stalks, were cattle and sheep and goats - all trying to get into the shade, and out of the wind.  In one place a clean, thin, kind looking woman came out from a group of little huts and spoke to one of our men.  I supposed of course she wanted baksheesh but he said no, she wanted something for her eyes which were very bad - and looking at them, I saw they were very bad - so I made her understand that she was to come to the boat with me, and I would give her something.  I gave her one of the big bottles of eye lotion that Dr. Sandwith had advised our bringing - and I also gave her an orange and some fruit, for which the nice creature seemed so grateful - kissing my hand over and over, with many thanks and blessings.Feb. 19th.  Quadragesima Sunday.              A repetition of yesterday - only that we have made one less mile.  We started at 5 - rowing until 8 o’clock - then tied up to wait Page 84for the wind to lull.  It has been a very pleasant day to me.  Late in the afternoon Nettie and I, and Howard, leaving Mr. Davis and Fielding at their chess, went up the bank, and through the pleasant fields, and across the bed of the canal into the desert and almost to the foot of the hills - how strange and lonely and fascinating it was! and what beautiful lights and colours everywhere.  I had a long talk with Salah about his people, and we were almost home, having hurried along as we saw the wind was rising, when we were met by little Ali and another sailor who said the Reis was waiting to go off, but we no sooner had started then it fell again - the young moon however now gives quite a light, and the Reis is determined to push on into the night as far as he can.  Salah says he will go as far as Erment, 15 miles away.Feb. 20.  Luxor.              I heard the men at their oars all the night through whenever I wakened, until about 4 o’clock we pulled up, and great was my astonishment when I opened my window quite early to find we were lying at our old place at the Gezireh opposite Luxor - and we heartily congratulated our poor tired men on their nights work and promised them a sheep.  We went over soon after breakfast to visit the hotel and read the latest telegrams, and to get certain things, and then Theodore and I went to old Mohammed Mohassibs.  The blue rhinoceros that we saw as we went up, and for which he asked the enormous sum of £100 he sold to the Russian Prince Lottykof - who is enormously rich, and has an American wife, said to have been a variety singer - who is certainly very Page 85pretty - for we have seen her on various occasions.  They have the biggest and finest dahabeah on the river, and have been near us several times.  In the afternoon we crossed in our felucca, and rode over to Karnac and had a charming visit.Feb. 24th.              We left this morning most reluctantly, feeling that we could give no more time to it.  It was hard to say goodbye to fascinating familiar landmarks.  We have had four lovely days here.  On Wednesday we went over to Medinet Habou soon after breakfast, leaving Theodore and Fielding as usual, glued to their chess board.  They were to follow us later, but it was almost one o’clock when they arrived, and lunch was ready.  Salah had prepared his table in one corner of the great hypostyle hall, but we found it so draughty, that, thinking of Theodore’s cold, we went searching about for a better place - and pitched upon one of the side rooms at the back of the older portion of the temple - and here we ate it, sheltered from the wind, and partially from the sun, while little Zenobia, or was it Fatima, I always mix those two children, waited patiently with her goolah.  Most of the roofing of this room was gone - only one great architrave remaining, on which was sculptured a row of such delightful cynocephalus apes, that with the help of some of our men, I clambered up a ruinous staircase and photographed them, though the light and position were not all I could have wished.  Then I photographed Zenobia, and some parts of the temple.  We had feared that we would meet gangs of tourists, for 3 Cooks boats were in, and Page 86one Gage steamer - but fortunately most of them had gone in the other direction, to the Tombs of the Kings etc.  so that we had this grand, most interesting temple quite to ourselves.   Here, as everywhere else, great numbers of Arabs were busy excavating, digging into the great mounds of brick and rubbish, which had filled and overflowed the temple enclosure and walls.  They were at work on the span between the Pavilion and the temple proper - I saw the Pavilion more thoroughly than I have ever seen it.  When the heat of the day was on the wane, Theodore, Nettie and I rode over to Der el Bahari - the others going home and across to Luxor for something.  There is no spot about Luxor so fascinating to me as this temple of the great Hatasu - or Hatshepsu, as it is getting to be the fashion to call her.  The spot chosen for it is so unique - in a cul-de-sac of the great yellow cliffs, which tower sheer above it in fantastic forms until they meet the blue sky.  The imagination supplies the magnificent approach that once led to it from the river, across the plain and up to its level in a series of terraces - with its obelisks and avenues of sphynxes.  The sculptured paintings on what is left of this temple are so beautiful and curious, that one never tires of looking at them.  All the weary, never ending kings offering to Gods - all the array of Isises, Horuses, Khnums, Khonsus, Anubises, and the like, give place to cheerful portrayal of life and its occupations - and the minute history of Hatshepsut’s famous expedition to the land of Punt, and its return.  The ships laden with spoil - the processions with strange animals and foreign trees and shrubs, are charmingly painted.  One of the great features of the place, is the wonderful view from the upper Page 87terrace, looking down that valley of desert desolation, to the radiantly green plain - to the river, with the houses of Luxor on the opposite bank, backed by the cultivated fields and palm trees, and the yellow cliffs beyond.  With the exception of the houses of Luxor, the scene must have been much the same as in the days of Hatshepsu.  The temples of Gurneh and the Ramesseum were not then built, but they are in such utter ruin that they do not now form special features in the plain from this height.  The temple of Amenophis III before which stood the Colossi was not in existence, and not a vestige of it remains, though the Colossi still sit in battered existence - neither was Medinet Habou built - but over in Thebes the great Karnac was standing though not as we know it with the gigantic hall of columns of Seti Ist, but the older temple of the Thotmes stood, with Hatshepsu’s splendid obelisks, almost in a line with her temple here in Der el-Bahari - what a splendour it must have been!  There is great excavating going on here, under M.  Naville - and we came away half blinded and choked by the dust which the army of excavators were making - and I had my last favorite gallop across the green fragrant plain, and we arrived at home very hot and tired and glad to escape from the noisy donkey boys and the clamours for baksheesh into the cool quiet dahabeah, where tea was waiting, and the friendly samovar steaming its welcome.  The temple of Luxor has been tremendously excavated, and is now most imposing and interesting - and the forest of papyrus columns which I have always thought one of the most beautiful sights of the river, has now been laid bare, to the bases of the columns.  The great colonnade which was even more buried, has also Page 88been entirely cleared, and adds immensely to the effect from the river.  They are still very busy with the Rameses II end - have cleared away a great many native houses, and laid entirely bare one of the pylons and the sitting Colossus - down upon which you look from the height of the street opposite.  The mosque still stands on the untouched ground, but that will soon be removed and the other pylon and colossus laid bare, the head of which now only shows.  This work in Upper Egypt is all being conducted by the Ghizeh Museum, and is of immense value.  Here at Luxor there are several lines of little tramways, with iron dumping cars, which dump the earth over the river bank, adding much to its improvement.  We were at the temple yesterday just as all the men stopped work for the noon reSt. What a busy hive it was!  Mohammed’s friend and patron, the well known Russian M. Goliniescheff was at Luxor with is beautiful boat the Zet-el-Nil (Spirit of the Nile).  He bought her two or three years ago, and has spent, so Mohammed says over £2000 on her since.  M. Goliniescheff had invited Theodore to come and see her, and one morning as we were in our felucca, Theodore and I, stopped to make a visit.  She was charmingly fitted up.  The next day M. Goliniescheff returned the visit, bringing with him some photographs he had made of his boat.  They have our old Reis Achmet, and some of our sailors.  We had light north wind, or no wind during our four days at Luxor - and in spite of north wind today, we have made a fine run of 44-1/2 miles, and are now at Keneh, and will see Denderah tomorrow, which is just across the river.Page 89Feb.  25.                Theodore and I took Salah, Jones and my Mohammed and went into Keneh directly after breakfast, to look for a certain antiquity dealer M. Goliniescheff had told him about.  I had the most charming donkey I have ever mounted - fleet and easy - a beautiful mouse colour with a black stripe along his back.  The ride of about 2 miles along a fine high road, with people on foot, on camels, on donkeys and horses in the fresh fine morning air, was delightful.  Keneh is a large, important town of over 15,000 inhabitants - and is as famous now as in ancient days for its pottery - jars and kullas, which are exported in enormous numbers.  One of the most picturesque sights of the river from here down, being the native boats piled with these jars.  At the time of the Mecca pilgrimage, Keneh is filled with pilgrims, as this is the starting point for caravans to Koser on the Red Sea, and other ports.  We went through most devious ways and curious places, and I never have had such an insight into native ways of living.  I dismounted four times to enter as many houses, and I could only wonder when I came away, that a pestilence was not always raging there.  At one place we found some interesting things, for which Theodore bargained unsuccessfully at the time, but they were brought to the dahabeah this evening for final barter, and Theodore got them for much his own price.  One of them was a curious alabaster pot in the form of a monkey clasping a small monkey in his arms, with the cartouche of Merenra of the 6th dynasty on his right arm - the figure about 5 inches high - the alabaster toned and worn with age.  A gold ring with royal cartouche - a dagger with gold Page 90ornaments - 2 inscribed cylinders - and some beads for me - all for £25 when 40 was at first demanded.  We got home in time for an early lunch, and were again in our saddles for Denderah.  I had my charming donkey of the morning “Telephone” and the ride would have been pleasant if it had not been so very very hot - and I wore my smoked goggles and veil.  The first view of this temple is always distinctly offensive to me, with its cumbrous, heavy topped Hathor headed columns, but the rest is delightfully interesting because of its decorations.  I thought I should have had a sunstroke coming home, which I did on a hard gallop.  We are moored on the Denderah side this evening, the wind blowing so that we cannot move, the brilliant moon makes the night bright, and the air soft and pure.  Mr. Fielding with Howard, and Salah and Jones have gone over to Keneh this evening.Feb. 26.  2d Sunday in Lent.              We started at 6 A.M. the men rowing - wind from north.  At Keneh the river makes an abrupt bend straight away to the West.  It was very warm, and our men rowed until I felt quite unhappy about them - then we drifted foolishly here and there, and bumped the bow in one bank and then the stern into the other bank, until as we came to the great Gebel at the bend of the river before reaching the town of Kasr-es-Saiyâd the wind became very fitful and Theodore and the rest taking a fancy to land for a walk, we stopped unfortunately to put them off and the men who were tracking could not hold the rope, and away we went waltzing into the stream - afterwards in pulling to the anchor for the opposite Page 91shore, the anchor was lost - we put down another one, and are now lying in the stream while the men are out in two small boats searching for the anchor.  It is vexatious to be detained in this fashion, the moon is so bright now, we might have gone on until late in the night.  These brilliant nights are fascinating - and the transition effects from sunset to moonlight have a delicacy and beauty which must be seen, to be realized.  Made 30 miles.Feb. 27.              I found when I looked out of my window this morning, that we were still lying in the stream, and all through the night I heard the men in the boats, and the stir of movement on board - and M.S. told me they had had no rest - Theodore felt much annoyed at the delay, and after breakfast gave orders that he would not wait much longer, as the £3 which the Reis said the anchor was worth was much more than balanced by his daily expense of £9.  But it was really after 12 o’clock before the Reis, whose fault it was for not buoying his anchor, called in his men, and gave up the search.  The poor fellows looked tired enough, as in the hot sunshine they took up their big oars, and began to row us down stream again.  We are now drawn up at a little village within 10 miles of Balliana, making 16 miles since we started at 12 o’clock.Feb. 28.              We arrived at Balliana this morning, making the 10 miles by hard rowing.  We caught up with a dahabeah which passed us yesterday, flying the French flag, but she did not stop - and one of the Cooks daha             Page 92beahs, the Ammon-Ra which we left at Assouan, overtook us and passed down, towed by a tug.  The day has been extremely hot, the thermometer on Theodore’s shaded balcony marking 80 degrees - and 79° in the salon.  We are now in a very rich country - the cultivated land being about 9 miles wide on this side of the river.  Milner says that “Egypt as a geographical expression is two things - the Desert, and the Nile - as a habitable country it is only the Nile”.  The river is now running down very fast - the banks are much higher than when we went up - and many sand banks are showing themselves, from the size of a mere patch to long stretches.  The fellaheen have a way of planting corn stalks in the low water whether to mark a certain kind of crop he intends to plant, or to preempt as it were the newly fertilized ground, I do not know.  The moist stretches of ground from which the water has just receded, leaving its rich deposit, are being planted with water melons - the bean crops are 3 and 4 feet high, and the rich crops of barley and wheat are in head - through these, here and there are little mud elevations like a huge barrel, from which a watch is kept against depredations of birds, or man.  Their agricultural implements are very crude - a wooden hoe, shaped something like a crescent with coarse teeth, ploughs of most primitive description.  But given the necessary irrigation, nature is so beneficent here, that no hard culture is needed.  I saw some time ago, a cow and a calf, pulling a plough, side by side, and quite 12 feet apart.  The condition of the fellah, since the evil days of Ismail, and especially since the English occupation, is so improved that considering the simplicity of his wants, the amenities Page 93of the climate, and the easy culture of the land, he is more comfortable and happy than the peasantry of other countries.  The Kourbash and the carver banished, and his taxes lessened, and the contstant improvement of irrigation methods, have made his life quite another thing.  The agriculture of the land is in the hands of the fellah - and they compose about 4/5 of the population.  Few of them, it is said, suffer from real poverty - many of them are the proprieters of the lands they cultivate and the many public works now carried on, give employment to the poorest.  They are a cheerful, good natured people - honest to a certain degree - apt to quick passion, which however seldom reaches violence, and very superstitious.  They seem entirely lacking in independence - and have absolutely no initiative - they must have some one to lead and guide them - hence the English officers in their army are a real necessity.  They are devoted to Islamism - and under evil influences are ready to burst into fanaticism.  I suppose it is impossible for us to realize the contempt with which they regard all foreigners and Christians.  We know ourselves to be so much superior, that it is difficult to believe that they can consider us with anything like contempt.  The two races and civilizations stand so far apart, that however friendly we may be as individuals we cannot understand each other.  We have often remarked upon their curious dullness of the senses - their preceptions and sensibilities are not keen - they seem almost indifferent to pain and physical discomfort.  I think they are like children and animals - they do not suffer from imagination, which makes half of our suffering.  They never seem able to divide their attention between two objects, which is Page 94so natural to us.  If you wish to speak to them, it is quite impossible to attract their attention if they are speaking to some one else, or watching something, or engaged in their own thoughts.                Theodore not being well, and I not wanting to take the long ride to Abydos in the heat, we stayed at home, the rest starting after an early lunch at 12 o’clock.  They reported it very hot going out, but very pleasant coming back in the bright moonlight.March 1st.              We passed Girgeh this morning at 10 o’clock - then Mensheyeh, and pulled up at Akhmim at 4 o’clock for the night - having made 27-1/2 miles, with little or no wind.  Theodore had resolved on the way up to stop here as we came down, and had been told of some valuable things he could find here.  We are lying just above the town, and rowed down immediately in the felucca and walked into the town - found it very interesting and more nearly approaching the picturesque than anything I have seen along the Nile.  Salah was affectionately welcomed by many people - though this is not a tourist’s town, but he has been here several times with M. Goliescheff.  We went into a very good house, but found nothing we wanted - most of the things being Coptic.  We rowed back to the boat through the glory of the most beautiful sunset I ever saw - a mingling of sunset and moonrise.  Just as I was dressing for dinner Theodore knocked at my door to tell me that a large dealer in the town had come to the boat to speak to Salah, and to say that he would send two donkeys for this evening to go to his house - and that I was to Page 95dress for the expedition.  So after dinner, taking Salah and Jones and my Mohammed, Theodore and I went up the bank and found a man on a donkey with 2 fine donkeys waiting for us - and we set forth in the beautiful moonlight.  Instead of going into the town we had seen in the afternoon, we turned away from it to another part which lies beyond the ruins of the old temple.  Akhmim is built upon the site of ancient Khemmis which disputes with This-Abydos for the oldest town in Egypt.  But little can be seen of the ancient buildings.  A great necropolis from which hundreds of mummies have been taken, was discovered in 1884, by Maspero.  We first took our way for a long distance through a broad kind of an avenue with high walls on either side, overhung with palm trees, through which the full moon looked down upon us, then through a scattered palm forest, when we came to the necropolis with its mounds of rubbish and yawning chasms, and up and down we went through this ancient burying ground with its occasional little mosques glimmering in their whiteness, until we came to the ruins of the old temple past which we rode, and on for some distance, until we came to a town clean looking, and with rather important houses on either side its narrow streets - before we entered it a guard, well armed, joined us - we passed a group of men sitting at the gate, and I don’t think we saw another being, until we stopped before a new, large and quite handsome house, the owner of which Salah said, had made all his money in antiquities.  Here we dismounted and were conducted through the court to a large room, well lighted and furnished, with glass cases about, containing the collection - and here we stayed for more than an hour, and although we were disappointed Page 96in what we saw, Theodore brought away a few very interesting things, for which he paid £15, £40 being first asked.  There were some beautiful carvings in stone - but these were too big and too heavy for us to think of buying.  When we came out of the house, we found several men had gathered about - and I had mounted, when Theodore and Salah were called back to look at something, and I waited for them.  One of the men came up to me and tried by gesticulation and words to make me understand him - raising his eyes again and again to heaven - then he rushed into the house and was back again in a moment saying to me with the greatest delight, “Jesus loves me” “I am Christian”!  and I smiled and said goodbye, leaving him very pleased.  What a delicious ride home that was, the air was so soft.  I had only a light wrap - the splendid moon - the weirdness of it all - the silence - the occasional barking of a dog, or a challenge from our guard.  We said goodbye when we reached the bank to our kind people, with thanks for the donkeys and the pleasant experience, and climbed down into our boat.March 2d.              We passed Sohag quite early this morning and have come to within 2 miles of Tahtah, making again 27 miles, in spite of the wind.  We are lying in a lovely spot near the great Gebel Shêkh el-Harfdeh, at the foot of some very high cliffs, and at their base a group of palm trees which are waving and rustling their great plumes above us, while the moon is radiantly beautiful.  We have been sitting on deck all the evening, - I in thin stockings and slippers - the day has been very warm.March 3d.              Passed Tahtah early this morning - and then Gou-Aboutig, and brought up at the little Gezireh opposite Assiout about 6 o’clock in the evening - having made a fine run of 44 miles.  Howard and Salah immediately went into the town for our mail.  The day has been very still of course to have allowed us to make such progress and very warm.  Mercury on the back balcony went up to 87°.  We had an awning on deck, and I sat there most of the day.  I do revel in the special beauty of these hot Nile days - the placidity of the river - the yellow of the cliffs - with their soft pink tinges reflected in the water - the brilliant green cultivated land - the whole thing dissolved in soft opalescent tints - and the hush of peace everywhere.  We are now in one of the widest and richest of the Nile valleys - the wheat is high and luxuriant, and the barley in beard - and masses of soft scent trees give the country a park like effect.  March 5.  3d Sunday in Lent.              We stayed all day in Assiout yesterday.  I went into the bazaar with them all, and found it very warm and the sun tremendously bright, so that after going to the telegraph and P.O. Theodore walked home.  In the afternoon I stayed at home, and not having the courage to face the blaze and heat again, the rest rode out through the town to the mountain to see the tombs, which are not interesting - the view however is superb.  We started early this morning, but the wind was so violent we tied up under the shelter of a high bank for 4 hours - and the awnings were              Page 98stretched to protect us from the wind - but it was a delicious pure air and I felt it so life-giving that I stayed on deck most of the day.  Theodore gave the men the usual sheep at Assiout, and we brought a nice fat little fellow along in the small boat.  I was pleased to see him released from captivity as we drew up, and when I was called below to luncheon, I left him merrily nibbling at the herbage on the bank - I went on deck again immediately after luncheon and to my horror way his brown hide stretched to dry almost on the identical spot where I left him cropping the grass - and his body hanging at the cook’s larder.  What an example of the transitoriness of life! We moved away late this afternoon, after the wind lulled, and had got well out into the stream, when it was discovered that we had left one of our sailors behind us - and sending the small boat off, he was found asleep in the young wheat.  We are now about 10 o’clock anchored in the stream opposite Manfaloot thus making 26 miles.  The moon was so bright the men were able to row later.  I have just finished reading Peter Ibbotson for the second time.  The first time I read it, I was so touched and enamoured with it, that I thought I might have overrated it - but there is the same charm about it - which though rather difficult to put into words, is none the less potent.  It is a venture to attempt explanation of the mystery of the other life, and of the heart breaking separation that divides one loving soul from another at death.   That he touches upon truthful possibilities and that if we cultivated our spiritual instincts more assiduously we might bridge over some of the dark places that divide the natural and spiritual, I think no one will deny.Page 99March 6.              We made 10 miles this morning by 11 o’clock - when coming within a mile of two of the great Gebel Aboufoydah, and the wind increasing, that we pulled up to the sand bank opposite the great cliffs, almost at the same place where we spent a day and night in a great sandstorm two years ago - when Mr. Chester and his friend who were also laid by, came over and spent the day with us.  I have been beautifully busy about all sorts of things today.  Theodore, Nettie, Howard and Mr. Fielding, accompanied by the inevitable Jones and Salah, went out with their funs [sic; guns] for some sport - but brought nothing back.  They reported it very windy and hot, as I found myself, in strolling along the bank looking at some fellaheen planting water melons.  This evening the men gave a regular jamboree - dancing and singing - in curious costumes - and were very merry.March 7th.              We have made a fine run today starting at 6 A.M. for the first time since we left Assouan, we unfurled our sails with the exception of one day, when we were making a difficult landing.  For 2 hours we came along finely with a gentle breeze, when it drew ahead again, and the sails had to be furled.  We passed Tel el-Amarna, where we had intended stopping, but not liking to interrupt such unusual progress, we kept on, and at 5 o’clock pulled up at Rhodah, where most of them went ashore for a walk and an inspection of the sugar factory - and we floated down past the factory and below the village and tied up - such Page 100a soft brilliant sunset! Camels and cattle - people and flocks all going home along the path at the top of the bank, making black silhouettes of themselves against the crimson gold of the sky.  They all came home with their guns.  Salah and one of the men carrying one of the huge baskets, which are always so engaging - and such pretty masses of colour, fresh lettuce and tomatoes, oranges and lemons, and bunches of pink roses and buds.  Made 30 miles.March 8th.              We drew up to Beni Hassan this morning at 7 o’clock and I was at once awakened as every one else on the boat must have been by the clamour of the donkey boys.  We were off for the mountains soon after breakfast - the sun very hot, but a cool delicious wind blowing that made it tolerable.  We went first to the Speos Artimedos, which I did not see before - and which is well worth a visit - then to the well known tombs up on the mountain.  These tombs have been much cleared of rubbish and protected since we saw them last and we found the public regulations greatly improved and we were a much more quiet and orderly party with no following of noisy natives fighting with themselves and the officers.  We had one well mounted police officer only today.  We stopped after seeing the tombs to look at the wide view beneath and about us - showing so plainly the absolute dividing line of desert and cultivated land - then finding a good south wind blowing, we hurried back to the boat, which had dropped down the stream a distance, the plank was immediately drawn in and we were off, at one o’clock.  How cool and quiet the cabin seemed Page 101and how appetizing the lunch table looked with its bottles of beer and mineral waters and the fragrant big dish of salad, that Salah is famous for - tomatoes - lettuce - and the silvery delicate young Egyptian onion! We reached about 5 o’clock having made 25-1/2 miles - we are lingering over these last days of our voyage - our rooms at Shephards are engaged for the 22d so that we have time enough and no inclination to get back to Cairo and civilization.  March 9th.              We have made quite 25 miles today, and are now 2 or 3 miles below Colossaneh.  It has been a remarkable day.  A very cloudy morning ushered in a day of very strong fitful wind - and this afternoon everything became so threatening, that we felt we must be going to have a tempest - and presently Howard exclaimed, “the sand is coming behind us” and sure enough it was - in a whirl that blotted out trees and mountains, and lashed the river into yeasty waves.  Everything was carried below in a jiffy - wraps, books, glasses, writing materials and all the parphernalia with which we burden the deck every day - rugs were snatched up - and chairs laid down.  Theodore and Mr. Fielding even forsook the chess board to which they are usually glued, and rushed to see what the matter was.  We let our anchor go, and waited to see what the storm would come to - in half an hour it began raining, and rained quite smartly.  But before the sun set, it was quite clear again, and the freshly washed air quite delicious.  I went on deck while every one else had forsaken it, but finding it still damp and wet, was going down again when Jones brought Page 102a dry thick rug for the floor, and an easy chair and my big cloak, and I sat snugly comfortable until it was time to go below and dress for dinner.March 10th.              When I first looked out of my window this morning, the mist was driving and rolling from off the river, giving a most curious effect - showing how much colder it was than usual - and I shivered through my dressing.  We had been under way for some time, and had passed Abou Girgeh - and by 11 o’clock were pulling up to Maghaghah, where we were to post letters, get out mail, and a box of Apollinaris waiting for us, which had been sent on from Cairo.  Theodore called out to me that they were going to walk into town, so I left my letters which I had been impatiently writing all the morning, and hurried off with them.  The morning was delicious - and we enjoyed our walk, the town quite pretty, with the inevitable sugar factory and railway.  A small canal with pollard willows on either side led through part of the town, looking quite English and very pleasant.  We went through the market square, and to the very good little railway station and then to the river by another way - the canal and willows skirting a meadow with cottages and little gardens opposite.  A number of Europeans live here - and we stopped at a neat little house, its verandah covered with vines, and the little garden bright with flowers, to compliment the comely Scotch body, who sat on the verandah, on her flowers.  Her husband, a Scotch engineer of one of the factories came out and was very friendly - giving me some white Page 103roses and gilly flowers.  We have come along gaily under our sails today, and pulled up at 7 o’clock at Benisoef, having made 58-1/2 miles.  For days we have been passing through the pigeon country, all the towns have the houses crowned with the curious pigeon towers - looking like pylons - and the pigeons swarm and circle in the air.  March 11th.              Did not start until 7 o’clock - morning cold and thick with gale from the South - made only 3 miles, stopping at an interesting looking Coptic Der, or Convent, into which we found we could not enter, as the two inmates had gone over to Benisoef, and taken the key with them.  We then went a little farther and attempted to land on the lee bank, the wind being very stiff, but we brought up with a slight bump upon some rocks - and so put out in the stream again and made for the other shore.  March 12.  4th Sunday in Lent.              We passed Zawieh early this morning, and came on to Wastah 4 miles below, where we are now lying - making 10 miles - intending to visit the pyramid of Medûm.  I was not feeling very well this A.M. and did not like the long ride in the sun - so stayed at home - and had a busy quiet day.  The dahabeah “Eva” flying the American flag, with a Mr. and Mrs. Goddard, is lying near us.  Such a laughable scene occurred this afternoon.  I had walked to the end of the deck looking at a native boat, with its cargo of men and women, donkeys and horses making a landPage 104ing next us.  A very large camel was on board, and was the very last thing to attempt landing, the men holding him by the bridle, made a motion to encourage him to make his jump over the low side of the boat but the camel declined and and suddenly turning jumped into the river pulling the man with him, and began making for the opposite shore - when the man emerged from his unexpected plunge, he clambered on the camel’s back and shouted for help - some of our men jumped into the felucca, and went out to his rescue, and finally succeeded in towing the camel in - but when he reached shallow water, he laid down on his side and for sometime refused to move.  I am sure he had a good reason for such behavior.  Which reminds me that yesterday that Nettie and I and Mr. Fielding started for a walk, and struck across the country to a canal embankment we saw - from which we looked over wide fields of grain - the barley well bearded, and the wheat almost as far advanced - and here and there the little cleared spaces for the flocks - which always give such a pleasant aspect to Egyptian fields - with their little groups of animals and men - looking almost like appartments.  At one place we came upon one of these with a dozen or more camels feeding, with 3 very young camels - skipping and playing about - and anything more ludicrous and awkward than their gambols, I have never seen - they suggested very, very huge Grand-daddy-long-legs in sportive humour.  I thought it a good chance to get some camels milk, which I have been wanting to try, but have never been able to get - so after a great mix of English and Arabic words and many gesticulations we succeeded in making them understand what we wanted - they said “aiwah” so we sent one of our men back Page 105to the boat for a pitcher - but after that came it proved very difficult to make the camel give down her milk - but we did get a little, and very delicious and delicate it was.              I have been reading for the second time, Lady Duff Gordon’s “Last Letters from Egypt”.  They are very charming - quite aside from their literary merit, which is great.  The entire self forgetfulness that made her strong enough to come and spend her last suffering years in a strange land, and to throw herself heartily and helpfully into the lives and interests of the people about her, is very lovely.  There is such noble, catholic sympathy in every page of her letters, that it makes one serene to read them.  I should like to have known the old Sheik Yussef - her familiar friend and adviser at  Luxor.  I asked our old Mohammed Mohassib one day at Luxor, if he were still living.  “No”, he said, “he died last year - he was a great good man - but he has a son now living here”.  In her last letter to her husband, written a month before she died, she urges him as he had not been well, not to attempt coming to Egypt - for, she says “it would be too painful for me to part with you again; and as it is, I can wait patiently for the end among people who are kind and loving enough to be comfortable, without too much feeling of the pain of parting”.  March 13th.            This had been the worst day I have ever known in Egypt.  We came about 4 miles from Wastah, but at 9 o’clock the gale was so strong from the north, that Theodore gave orders to tie up, and we have not Page 106stirred since, except as the violent wind has battered us about.  There is really a heavy sea on - and the sun shines only fitfully from out the brown sky - and the sand flies, penetrating everywhere.  A “raconteur” or wandering minstrel came along this morning, with a curious wooden musical instrument, with only 2 strings, which he played with a bow - something like an attenuated violincello - he brought out a wonderful variety of sound, and sang or recited in a very dramatic manner.  Our sailors sitting about the deck, wrapped in their shawls, enjoyed it immensely.  The afternoon was the dullest I have ever spent on the Nile.March 14.              When I awakened this morning I heard the men at their oars, and at breakfast Mohammed said we had made about 14 miles.  The morning was cool with a good many clouds hanging about, and last night, I heard it raining smartly, for a few moments.  We were on deck soon after breakfast, glad enough to get out again.  The Meydoum pyramid had disappeared from sight, but the Dashur pyramids and finally the Sakkarah came into sight.  What tremendous things they are - especially seen from a distance - they then show their enormous size and dominate the country.  As the morning wore on, the wind grew very cold, and drew out straight ahead, and after drifting about some time, we tied up near a pretty spot, where was a kind of cottage now deserted, and what had been a fine garden.  After lunch we went up the bank, and walked about the garden, which was filled with young orange and lemon trees -and a great many pomegranites, now just coming into their new red and green foliage.  Page 107We found some superb thistles, with beautiful variegated leaves, making a very decorative plant - and a lot of small chicory flowers - quite like ours, but smaller and of a more branching habit.  And Hassan found a green Mantis insect, which Jones took home.  The air has been delicious today - so cool and grateful and fragrant.  We have made today about 25 miles - and are now lying below some lofty pines, within a few miles of Bedrasheyn, which we will reach tomorrow.  The wind is at last quiet - and the night serene.March 15th.              Arrived at Bedrasheyn this morning early, making 10 miles - and directly after breakfast, started out to Memphis and Sakkarah.  A more perfect day could not have been imagined - cool and a trifle cloudy it was quite perfect.  Five years ago, on just such another morning I took that same charming ride - through the pleasant palm groves, and past the mud villages and across the fields, with their fragrant blossoming crops, and herds of cattle and sheep in their little camps, made by cutting down the crop for a space, and leaving the rest as enclosing walls.  Then again into the palms, where lie the two colossal recumbent figures of Rameses II, and where we stopped to see what was not to be seen when we were here before, the excavations of the famous temple of Ptah, which has been lying for centuries under a magnificent grove of palms - it was curious to see the trees left in a huge ball of earth, perhaps for transplanting, and the ruined walls, columns, broken statues etc.  - lying down below.  The bases of the columns which are in place, are Page 108truly colossal, and the carvings and inscriptions on them, and on the walls, are in beautiful style.  We reached Mariette’s house just in time for lunch, which we had taken with us, and found two parties already lunching there.  One of them was the Russian Prince Soltykoff with his dragoman, a crowd of servants - silver service - easy chairs - embroidered coverings, and I don’t know what all.  His dragoman told Salah that he had quarelled with his pretty wife, and sent her back to Paris.  He looked most lonely, a weak young fellow, and had a hollow cough.  We walked about, and sat down on that long wide, covered verandah waiting for our lunch to be ready - and saw the departure of the English party, the arrival of a German group - and the getting under way of two or three camels, laden with the elaborate Soltykoff equipage - then after we had lunched, went to the Serapeum, and to the tomb of Ti, which is much better seen than formerly - a new roof now covers it, and a sky light which seems incongruous - but it affords protection, and enables one to see the fascinating interior, it is a beautiful work of the Ancient Empire.  We lingered about in the desert, and rode leisurely home, in as roundabout a way as we could - for it was all so charming - earth, air, sky - and we felt it was our last expedition.   We are lying in a beautiful spot - with the palms near us, with their fascinating perspectives, an English dahabeah near us.  We intend crossing the river tomorrow for a day at Helouan.March 16th.              I have passed the first dull day I ever had in Egypt!  We went Page 109over to Helouan this morning - a well known and much frequented health resort, with sulphur baths, lying in the desert.  A dreary, ghastly looking place, with its bright staring new french houses, and hardly a tree or shrub.  The late Khedive was very fond of this place, and indeed died there - and during his life time he discouraged all planting of trees and shrubs - believing the pure desert air contaminated by them.  We lunched at the Khedival Hotel - a modern large, luxurious hotel, much superior in its fittings and arrangements to Shepheards.  There were a lot of English people there - Mr. Fielding found some people he knew - and we were all glad to come away, and reach home, feeling the day had been quite wasted.  I should so much rather have stayed - and wandered through the palms and enjoyed Bedrasheyn.  March 17.              We made 13 miles between our landing place of last night, and our present one here at Ghizeh - just opposite the entrance gates of the palace, which is now the museum.  A strong North wind has been blowing all day, and we laid by two or three times, but about 5 o’clock were able to pull off up here at Ghizeh.  We went over to the palace at once, though it was past the museum hours, and went into the garden, and wandered about delightedly until almost dark, the air so soft, and the whole place to ourselves - with such superb, though eastern gardening - it seemed as if it might be fairyland.  The minarets of Cairo seem almost opposite us - and we much congratulate ourselves on our position.  The citadel with its slender minarets is a most striking feaPage 110ture as you approach Cairo but as you get nearer the effect is much lost - and the impression of airy height much lessened.  Salah went into Cairo tonight.  March 18th.             Salah came out on a donkey this morning early with a huge packet of letters and papers - having made an arrangement at Shepheards to supply us with carriages while we lie here.  We had intended going over to the museum after breakfast, but Theodore wanted to go in town and see the rooms that had been reserved for us at Shepheards, and wanted me to go with him.  We found a charming suite of rooms - but we do not want to take possession of them until the 22d.  We went to some shops, and then gladly drove back to our beloved Herodotus.  The day has been dull, and a very strong cold north wind blowing - and everybody in Cairo complaining of the unusual weather.  After lunch Theodore, Fielding, Nettie and I went into the museum.  Mrs. Davis and Howard electing to drive into town.  We made the round of the ground floor rooms mostly.  I am enormously impressed with the masterpieces of Ancient art, whenever I see them.  Ra Hotep and his wife Nefert-Ari sitting affectionately side by side for thousands of years! and the two Ranofer statues - and the Sheik el-Beled - they all seemed wonderful again, especially the Ranofers.  We were surprised and delighted to find two new statuettes of quite remarkable value, found at Memphis only two months ago of the 4-5th dynasty, one of them a sitting scribe - the finest thing I have seen in Egyptian art.  It is a seated scribe - 51 centimeters high - of calcareous limestone - the flesh is tinted red, and the hair black - the eyes of quartz Page 111with the lines of the eye lids in bronze - the modelling is fine - he holds a papyrus on his lap, and looks up from it with a serene, intent gaze, wonderful in its reality.  It was found in a brick mastaba at Sakkarah.  Then the wealth of stelae shown in that never ending succession of vast appartments - of such delightful interest, that one could spend months over them instead of hours.  Nettie is absorbed over all these things and as interested as I could wish her to be.  We could but glance at most of the curious monuments and treasures.  We had intended going into the garden afterwards, but I was blind with fatigue and all of us very tired, so we went home for tea and rest.March 19th.  5th Sunday in Lent.              The fast of Ramadan was ushered in last night by the firing of many guns from the Citadel - and all good Mohammedans now will neither eat or smoke until the evening gun tomorrow releases them from their fast, until the rising of the sun on the following morning.  The effect of this fasting is said to be none of the best - as shown in irritability and sickness - excessive nightly feasting , following the day of fasting.   Theodore, Nettie and I went to the Musuem this morning, the rest driving into church - but we found the Museum closed, and learned that from today, it will only open in the afternoons - so we divided our time between the garden and driving, and went back in the afternoon and spent all of it there.  Tonight as the sunset gun was fired from the citadel, breaking the fast of the day, a great shout went up from the city, which we could plainly hear - with the noise of drums and music.  Page 112There is always much noise and carousing and wickedness on Ramadan nights.  All our men at once fell with alacrity on their evening meal which was ready and waiting for them.  They all, with one or two not very honorable exceptions, keep the fast.  Nose, the haughty, is one of the exceptions.Monday, March 20.              Every time we have gone over to the garden, we have taken in with us two or three of our sailors - and they have so enjoyed it - passing the turnstile and seeing tickets bought for them - and the magnificence of the gardens, the fountains, the terraces, the little bridges over the islands, filled them with childish delight.  So, before we started out to the Pyramids this morning, I told Salah to invite the whole crew, from the Captain to the Captain’s boy, to go over, and I gave Abbocato the entrance money.  Mrs. Davis and I drove in the landau, the rest went on donkeys.  We lunched at the Mena - a beautiful hotel, crowded with English people.  We found Mr. Tylor, and Mr. Somers-Clarke there.  After our visit to the Pyramids and Temple of the Sphynx we went back to the hotel and had tea on the terrace.  The day has been disagreeable - a violent hot south wind blowing, sand flying, flies sticking.  We were very glad to get home.  Tonight is cloudy and threatening.  We are so sad that the last days of our Nile life are running away so faSt. I bestow special caresses upon Mish-mish, and find her antics more and more beguiling - and I wonder after Salah takes her to his Cairo home, if she will not long for the happy Nile days and her Page 113river companions.  We have already begun our packing - and tomorrow the dismantling will begin in earnest, alas!March 21.              It has rained hard most of the day.  We fussed and packed this morning and Nettie and I groaned and sighed every time we looked at each other.  Soon after lunch we all went over to the Museum, driving in the rain.  It was a free day, so we asked all the sailors to go with us.  It was so interesting to see how they all took it.  I think the vastness and splendor of the palace impressed them more, than all its treasures.  They were transfixed with amazement in the great central hall, where all the royal and priestly mummies lie in their glass biers.  Nose was so funny - after looking at one and then another he would look at me so sadly and stroke his head, as if he were saying, “this is too sad, take me away”.  We have been having our last tea round the smoking samovar and we are so sorry, that we are just stupid and dull.  March 23.              We are settled in a charming suite of rooms here at Shepheards quite at the opposite end of the house from that we were in before.  The sitting room has a projecting corner window giving a pleasant outlook on the terraces below, and the busy life of the street.  Most of the bed rooms lie on the garden side.  My big one does, with a little balcony overlooking the lovely garden - and opening out of the sitting room.  Page 114Everybody growls about the weather and indeed it is extraordinary - for a week past it has been cold, windy, with frequent rains.  We are a month later than we were before, yet I have never known it so cold here.  We left the Herodotus yesterday morning - the final dismantling and farewells always so sad, were at last made, and we and most of our belongings were piled into Shepheards big omnibus, and left that pleasant life behind us.  Some of our men have been up today to see us.  We went to the bazaar this afternoon.  March 24.              Nettie, Howard and I went to three Mosques this morning - that of Sultan Hassan which I had seen before - that of Bardemt, small, exquisitely decorated - properly a Zawiya, I suppose, where prayers are daily offered, but no sermons preached.  Then to Gami el-Muaiyad which was built 500 years ago, and is now being extensively and judiciously restored by a Society of Christians or foreigners, who look after ruinous architecture that is worth preserving - for no Musselman ever thinks of repairing anything.  It is very beautiful.  In the afternoon Nettie and I drove out on the Shubra, and saw a polo game for a little while, but we both agreed it was absurd to spend time in Cairo watching polo!  Theodore is not well.  Dr. Sandwith has seen him two or three times, and pronounces it liver.   He is put on a diet, and ordered daily exercise on a donkey.Page 115March 26.  Palm Sunday.              Weather is still extraordinarily cold - it is more like January than the end of March.  Storms rage on the Mediterranean, and two of the passenger steamers could not make a landing at Alexandria last week and had to go on to Port Said.  The Rubitino S.S. could not go out from Alexandria - and so on -  We have had a fire in the little open stove in our sitting room for 3 days - and there has been one in the reading room downstairs every evening, a thing I never saw before.  Dr. Wandwith [sic; Sandwith] who has been coming in often to see Theodore and who is extremely nice and interesting, and knows every thing about Egypt, was talking to me the other day about the hospital which is under his charge here, with a number of English nurses - and asked me if I would like to see it.  Whereupon we arranged to go yesterday, and Nettie and I drove around to his office for him in the afternoon - and then drove almost out to old Cairo - passing the great gardens and palace of Ibrahim Pacha, an uncle of the young Khedive - and then the huge palace which belonged to his great grandmother, and where all her servants and retainers still live.  The hospital is now what was formerly the Kasr el-Ain barracks, and is very large, in the form of a parallelogram - and has about 400 patients.  Barren and comfortless as it is in many respects, it was clean, and had not a particle of hospital odour about it.  There is a pleasant looking house within the walls, near thementrance [sic; the entrance] gate, but quite apart from the hospital, which is the home of the nurses.  We were welcomed by Miss Bishop, who went about with us - a tall, fair, nice looking young woman, fresh as a rose.  In all the Page 116wards into which we went the windows were permanently taken out - which shows what this climate is.  We saw one most extraordinary patient.  The Dr. called her his phonograph.  In her bed in a corner of one of the wards lay a very black woman - a Nubian - with her eyes closed, most of the time.  She imitates every sound and movement she hears or sees - perfectly unconsciously - of course understanding no language but her own.  Dr. Sandwith spoke to her in French, then in German, and English - she spoke in a low feeble voice, and with effort, as if she were moved by an invisible force.  I raised my lorgnette to look at her, and she at once imitated the movement even to spreading 2 fingers, and peering at me through them.  It was most curious.  The most interesting thing I saw though, was a merry little black boy of about 4 years, clean and nice, who hung about Miss Bishop all the time, who was most affectionate with him.  He went everywhere with us and she called him Jimmy, and he called her Sister.  When I remarked upon his very attractive face, she said O! this our little prisoner of war, the son of the great Dervish general and Prince, Wad el-Nejenne, who was killed in the battle of Toski - this boy was found on the battle field, then only a baby of 6 months, and given into the charge of a Nubian woman and sent to Cairo by Gen.  Grenfell, and committed to the care of the Sisters at the hospital.  He is quite an important little personage, and may perhaps have a role to play in the future.  Miss Bishop says the Soudanese often come to pay homage to him, and for a year or two, he was not allowed outside the walls of the hospital for fear he might be captured.  He gravely drew himself up, when we came Page 117away, and made the military salute.  The contrast of his present and future life, with his origin, is very interesting.  Before we left, Miss Bishop took us up to the roof of the hospital, which was quite flat without any projecting parapet or balustrade at the sides.  It forms the exercise ground for the women, and it looked very curious as we drove away, to see those draped figures against the sky.  We made the whole round of the building there, Jimmy frisking about us like a merry little dog.  The view from it was charming - the island of Rhoda across the narrow arm of the Nile, just opposite - the Pyramids in the distance - the crowd of minarets - the wide extent of Cairo.  It has been raining today much of the time.  I stayed at home with Theodore this morning, and Howard and I went to afternoon service at 5.  March 27.              There are a lot of Indian dignitaries staying in the hotel.  The Sultan of Jahore, who is very quiet and looks like a middle aged Englishman, and the Maharajah of Karpothalia, with their respective suites.  The latter people are very Indiany - and though they wear European dress, always wear, indoors and out, big, magnificent turbans, exquisitely arranged.  It is quite a sight to see them coming in to dinner, in the conventional evening dress, with their huge turbans - but it is still more of a sight to see them in the most extreme and correct English riding clothes, with pale blue, or rose coloured turbans.  The other evening there was a ball, or dance - and they came out in wonderful attire.  Nettie and I went into the bazaar this Page 118morning with Salah and made some purchases - and this afternoon in spite of threatening weather, we went to the Tombs of the Khalifs, and the Mosque of Sultan Hassan.  Nettie and Theodore on donkeys, the rest of us in the carriage.  It poured with rain when we were coming back, and we had to take Nettie and Theodore in with us and all the streets made themselves into lakes and rivers.March 29th.              Mr. Fielding has been staying for 2 or 3 days with some friends with whom he stayed before he went up the river, the Wilfrid Blunts.  They have a place at the edge of the desert near Heliopolis.  Mr. Blunt’s well known for certain eccentricities - a poet - some people think the greatest in England.  He affects eastern culture, and has tried for some years to transform himself into an Arab - has built an Arab house furnished in Arab style etc.  He was once imprisoned in England, for insurrectionary speeches to the Irish - and at another time, was requested by Lord Cromer to remain out of Egypt for a year, because of his sympathy in the Arab revolt.  His wife is said to be very charming and gifted, and an excellent Arab scholar.  She is Lady Anne Blunt, daughter of the Earl of Lovelace, and Ada, “sole daughter of my house”, the daughter of Lord Byron.  They have one child - a girl - I suspect Fielding of a tender interest there.  We were all invited out there one day - but thought it decent to decline as a party - but I made Theodore go.  He reported the place and the people quite delightful, and out of the ordinary - and said Lady Anne was a sad-eyed woman, but the Page 119most interesting he had ever met.  Mr. Blunt breeds Arab horses - and they are all great riders.  Miss Judith Blunt performs the Arab fantasia - brandishing the long pole, and managing her horse in Arab fashion.  This morning we went to the great mosque of Thulun - I think it the most impressive sight in Cairo - then to the Gami el-Azhar - the famous college or university - with its great courts, and groups of students - children and men - squatting about with their books before them - some preparing food and others eating - some stretched out at full length asleep - grave gray bearded men sitting on the ground, looking as if they were filled with the mysterious wisdom of the East, and discoursing of occult things.  Then we went to the Gami el-Hakkim now almost in ruins, and made into a kind of Arabian Museum.  This afternoon we all went some on donkeys and the rest in the carriage to the tombs of the Mamelukes, and saw those, and the singular ones of the Vici Royal family.  How strange they are in their curious shapes, crowded together in their queer rooms, with Brussels carpets on the floor, chintz curtains and covered divans and the sun looking cheerfully in through the red curtained windows.  One almost expects to come upon a tea table with afternoon tea and cakes.  Then we went up to the Citadel to the Mohamet Ali Mosque - beautiful with that view of the great city in its wide extent, with the glimmering Nile in the distance, and the distant form of the Pyramids.  When we got home Mr. Fielding and I went for some photographs, and then he proposed going to the Ezbekieh Gardens for tea and to listen to the music - but we walked from spot to spot - deciding one was too shaded - another too Page 120near the music etc. until we laughed and decided to go back to Shepheards garden, and have tea there.  But the fates were against us, we could find no one to bring tea to the garden, so we were forced to go in and take it prosaically in our sitting room as usual.  We have only one more day in Cairo, for we go on Friday the 31st to Alexandria, and take the P. & O. Cathay for Naples.March 30th.              We are all packed and uncomfortable - ready for tomorrows start - with the exception of Mr. Fielding who will of course do most of his packing after the omnibus is driven to the door, with Jones to help - and all the servants - that is the usual procedure.  We have had daily visits from most of our men - who generally station themselves across the street in the sunlight, and wait for some recognition from the windows - then they come over, and up to see us - faithful fellows - how we hate to leave them.  One day on coming home, I found Ali, the Reis’s boy waiting, and I brought him in and upstairs in the elevator with me, to his excessive delight and astonishment.  We have had 10 delightful days here - and I have seen a great deal of Cairo - at first the wretched crowds in the streets - the noise - the universal howling and shouting, oppress me, and irritate me - then I grow used to it, and finally fascinated.  In our daily drives to the mosques and places of interest, what extraordinary quarters we found, and what streets we passed through - such glimpses through open portals of wonderful interiors - such facades - with their carved Mushrebeyahs,              Page 121or projecting windows of beautiful woodwork - the narrow streets over which tower minarets and domes - how very fascinating and lovely it all is!Naples.       West End Hotel.  April 6.  Thursday morning.              We left Cairo on the morning of Good Friday, 31 March.  We brought Mohammed Salah to Alexandria and he took a tearful leave of us on the boat - we found the Cathay very comfortable - had pleasant passengers, and a smooth voyage across, arriving early on Tuesday morning.  We left Theodore with Fielding and Jones to do the Custom House, and drove to the Grand Hotel where we had written for rooms - but they were crowded, and sent us here to their dépendence - which we find pleasant enough for a few days.  It was formerly the old “Nobili” where I stayed years ago.  On Tuesday afternoon all the rest went to Pompeii.  Theodore and I went to the bankers and to some shops and for a drive over the colle to Posillipo - the wind very cold and strong, and the dust thick.  Yesterday the rest went to Vesuvius and came home late, tired and white with dust.  Theodore rested, and we took a drive and went to Capo de Monte, and through the large but uninteresting palace, and drove through the grounds - then about Naples.  It is always so radiantly beautiful - where else can one see such grandeur of scenery, with such beauty of colouring.  We are going to Monte Casino tomorrow, en route to Rome, to see the famous monastery.  Fielding who has stayed there has written to ask if we could stay a night Page 122and a day there - I have always looked at it with great curiosity, when passing it on the railway, away up on its airy height.Hotel du Quirinale       Rome.  April 8th.              We were off from Naples yesterday at 9 o’clock in the morning, and reached Cassino at 11:30.  We found two little carriages waiting for us, and were relieved to find that we would not, as Mr. Fielding thought, have to ride on mules.  We had arranged to take up only our bags and some rugs, so that if we wished to spend the night we could.  Jones went on to Rome with the luggage.  Since Mr. Fielding was here a very good road has been made up the mountain by Government.  We stopped a moment at the village to give the horses some water and I took a lot of photographs, of the people from the carriage.  The views as we ascended were entrancing until as we got up to the level of the Monastery we could see the world below us - the rich valley of the Garigliano and the bold chain of the Abruzzi Mountains.  After entering the walls, there is a short climb to the gate of the monastery where we found a big burly brother, his face purple with cold living and exposure, and who would hardly lift his eyes as Fielding talked to him.  Then the Prior whom Fielding addressed as “mon  Père” came to welcome us, a tall, spare dignified man, very shy with his French.  We walked about on the magnificent terrace, which is supported by the columns dividing several courts below, affording wonderful views, and then into the church, rich and splendid, built in 1727 on the site of Page 123the one founded by St. Benedict - whose remains with those of his sister St. Scholastica, lie beneath the high altar.  One of the large bronze doors of the church is inscribed with a list inlaid in silver of the possessions of the Monastery in 1066.  We were then asked into a large bare room where a colazione was spread for us, which in our famished state was very acceptable, and we were not critical.  The prior had said there was an American brother in the convent, whom he would send to us, and after our lunch there appeared a stout, jolly brother, whose name was Julian, and he proved to be a Pennsylvania dutchman, who did not speak the most polished English.  He seemed overjoyed to see us, and welcomed us most fraternally as fellow Americans.  This monastery of Monte Casino was founded by St. Benedict in 529 on the site of an ancient temple of Apollo.  It now ranks as a “National Monument” and belongs to the Government, but still exists as an educational institution of theology.  There are about 30 monks and some lay brethren - and there are a telegraph office and printing office.  Brother Julian proved to be an instructor in Hebrew and Philosophy in the school and under his kind but rather fussy care we went the rounds of the great courts and library - only we women were not allowed to go everywhere.  The library was impressive - and seemed the very picture of a true mediaeval library - long and low and arched, with its windows in the deep embrasures of the enormously thick walls.  I almost expected to see Romola and her white headed father there.  These monks are the custodians of one of the most precious libraries in the world.  The stately handsome manuscript rooms into which we next went, and where Page 124we again met the Prior, hide behind their inlaid doors a famous mass of MSS. and the Archives hold a rare collection of documents - papal bulls - letters of emperors and kings etc.  We were shown beautiful volumes - splendidly illustrated.  Mrs. Davis and I with Fielding and Howard decided to stay over night - but Mr. Davis and Nettie went on to Rome by the afternoon train.  Mrs. Davis and I would not be allowed of course to remain within the convent enclosure, so we went down to have a look at the little guest house outside the gates - called St. Agatha’s house - which though not luxurious was decently clean.  Then Brother Julian turned us into the monastery garden running along one great wing of the convent - and we picked violets and daisies, and sat in the grass looking off into the wide valleys so far below us - when suddenly one of the under brothers appeared in breathless hurry to say we must come out at once, that no woman had ever been allowed there before, and gave us the impression that the end of the world was at hand, in consequence of our innocent transgression.  So much disgruntled we withdrew our dangerous persons - and Brother Julian soon reappearing we told him.  He seemed amused and perplexed by it - and in his simple, frank way, excused them - but it was very plain to see, from a very broad and higher ground - and I think the American brother disdained many of the restrictions and traditions of the monastery.  We walked about with him for awhile, and as the convent gates closed at 6 o’clock, and Fielding and Howard had to be within them at that hour, we said goodnight to Brother Julian, and the boys went down with Annie and me to St. Agatha’s for a few minutes.  The house was kept Page 125by an Italian peasant and his wife and daughter Marie - and being very hungry, we watched with some interest the preparations of our evening meal.  The little table in the bare little room below was ready, but no supper arrived - when finally the old man appeared from the convent with very bulging pockets, and produced a loaf of dark bread from one, from another 4 eggs, which Marie took to the kitchen to cook, and we had something called coffee - that was all.  The evening was dismal - and I went to bed at 9 o’clock, first hanging for a long time out of my window in the soft fresh mountain air - in front of which between the house and the edge of the cliff which fell sharply away, stood a tall young pear tree in densest white bloom, tossing its shadowing arms about - while a young crescent moon by the side of it made a decorative panel - and away down the mountain side, the valley lay in a white mist.  I was up at half past 5 the next morning to see the dawn begin, and after dressing went down and sat in the sun outside the house to get warm - and I photographed Marie, the pretty daughter of the handsome old woman - and then the mother - and then a young woman who happened along - and a charming young donkey who was running about like a dog.  After an impossible breakfast, which was a bad copy of the supper, we walked up to the monastery and joined Fielding and Howard - and said goodbye to the Prior and Brother Julian, and got into our little carriages, and clattered down the mountain, stopping at a ruined castle, and an ancient temple, and were soon on our way to Rome.Page 126April 19th.              This is the 11th day of our stay here, and tomorrow we are off to Florence.  It has not been very cheerful - for Theodore has been wretched, and for 2 days really ill.  He is never well in Rome - I always detest this Hotel du Quirinale at which we are stopping: but we are fortunate to get good rooms anywhere, for Rome is now full, and people crowding in for the celebration for the silver wedding of the King and Queen of Italy.  The German Emperor is coming tomorrow, I wanted really to see this cocky, energetic young Emperor.  The streets are ablaze with colour and flags, and arches and tiers of temporary seats everywhere.  It is a triumph for the King, and serves to offset the prestige of the Pope, with all the numerous pilgrimages which have been visiting Rome for weeks.  Pope Leo XIII may be a sweet and venerable old man - but all the same he is foolishly sulking in his self-imposed martyrdom as a prisoner in the Vatican - and temporal power seems a thing forever vanished from papal hands.  I immediately fall under the magical charm of everything in Rome, the moment I enter it - and though the changes are many - the charm remains - I have seen most of my old haunts.  And we have had a great pleasure in seeing mediaeval art with fresh critical eyes - as the promising young art critic Bernhard Berenson has been stopping with us for two days.  Theodore had been looking at a private art collection, the pictures of which were rather mysteriously offered for sale by its owner.  When happening to mention it to Mr. Bliss, a friend of Fieldings, who has been for years the agent or envoy or something of the English Gov. at Page 127the Vatican, he suggested, that from his knowledge of the Italians and their ways, he would advise Mr. Davis if he thought of buying, to have them examined by an expert.  “Where shall I find one”, said Mr. Davis.  Mr. Bliss advised writing to Mr. Berenson who was then in Florence, and asking him to come down for a look at them saying he probably knew as much if not more about Italian art than any man living.  That he was born in America of Russian parents - graduated from Harvard, then gone to Oxford and Berlin and had made for years a special study of Italian art.  So we wrote him, and he came and we have been going about with him and seeing for the first time with discerning eyes.  For the first time I have seen the ravishing sweetness of the frescoes of Melozzo da Forli, who was the pupil of Piero della Francesca.  These frescoes were painted in the dome of the church of S.S.  Apostole, and were removed when some alterations were made - and are now in the Palazzo Quirinale, and the minor Sacristy of St. Peters, called the Stanza Capitolare.  They are the most delicious things - almost modern and impressionist - and finely foreshortened.  Melozzo was called the father of foreshortening.  He died young and left nothing so far as I can find out but these, and a painting in the Vatican gallery, representing Sixtus IV and some cardinals.  We had one charming morning at St. Peters, Mr. Berenson and I, wandering around the great church, talking of its history, of its builders, of its treasures, and finding the iron gates of the chapel of the Holy Sacrament open, they generally being closed, we went in to look at the beautiful and splendid tomb of Sixtus IV - 1484, built in bronze by Antonio Pollajuolo - brought from Page 128the choir of old St. Peters where it was erected by his uncle the great Julius II, whose own tomb marked by a single slab lies near the more magnificent one of Sixtus IV.  Then we went to the Colonna Gallery, and looked at the few best pictures, among them that splendid portrait of an unknown by Paul Veronese - a study in green.  Another morning Nettie and I, Howard and Mr. B.  had a perfect morning among the pictures at the Vatican, and then went on to the Doria, which we found closed for the week of festivities, so we went rumbling home.  In the afternoon we all went to the Villa Borghese to see the Borghese collection transferred to the Villa from the Palazzo - and again it was a great pleasure to see through eyes more knowing and discriminating than ours.  We met Mrs. Ledyard there, whom we had missed in mutual visits.  Mr. Berensen went back to Florence tonight.  We have seen a great deal of a brother of Fieldings, who is in a Seminary here, being educated as a priest, Basil Fielding - quite unlike his brother in looks and character.  He too is charming - a big, pink and white young fellow, as full of fun as can be.Hotel de la Grande - Bretagne.       Florence.  April 20.              The ride from Rome this morning was delicious.  I have never seen Italy before in such entire spring costume.  The whole country is bitterly in need of rain, and crops will be a serious failure if it does not come soon.  Mr. Fielding had engaged rooms for us at the New York Hotel, having left Rome 3 days before we did.  He had tried Page 129for the rooms we wanted at every other hotel, without success.  But when we saw them we were so disgusted, we were in dismay;  and Theodore so tired and ill that he seemed to be quite helpless.  So I begged him to let me try to find others and he consented, though he felt it hopeless.  So, I took Howard, and getting into a cab, we came here, and found our present delightful appartment had just been vacated; so we went immediately back to report and by 5 o’clock were comfortably settled here.  I have a sweet, cheerful little yellow room, opening off the salon, with 2 big sunny windows, and we all look out upon the river and although the Lung Arno is always noisy, it is always bright and charming.  We are between the Ponte Vecchio and the Trinita with the picturesque line of opposite houses across the river, which everybody knows - and the mellow church bells clang from San Spirito church near, and the lights at night quiver on the river - and just now the new moon adds her pretty crescent to the scene.April 21.              Mr. Berenson turned up according to appointment  this morning, and we went first to Santa Maria Novella, and walking over its pavement of tombstones, their reliefs worn almost smooth, went to the Cappela Brancacci, at the end of the right transept to see the Madonna long famous as a production of Cimabue’s genius - but now denied as his as well as the pretty story of its loving welcome to Florence.  Then to the chapel of the Strozzi, the frescoes of which by Fillippino Lippi of the story of the lives of S.S. Peter and John, have been sadly Page 130retouched and restored.  In the chapel of the choir, we sat and looked at the frescoes of Ghirlandajo - and in another chapel, at those of heaven and hell by Orcagna (Andrea) where it was plain to see Michel Angelo got his inspiration.  Then we went through the cloisters, and Spanish Chapel.  Then Mr. Berenson took us to the Palazzo Martelli to see a lovely bust of St. John the Baptist - and a statue of the same and the beautiful and spirited coat of arms of the Martelli family - all by Donatello.  In the afternoon Nettie and I drove out to San Miniato with Theodore and Nettie was in raptures over it - the first thing of the kind she had seen.  The old niello pavement, and the quaint marble work of the screen, are so good.  Just after we got home, Mr. Fielding with his mother Lady Denbigh came to see us - she a tall, sweet, sad faced woman, in deep black - with a charming voice.  Fielding and his sister Lady Clare paid us a visit last evening.  Mr. Berenson came to dine and a note from Mrs. Berenson asking us to dine the next evening.April 22.              We started out with Mr. Berenson at 10 o’clock this morning, and went to Santa Croce and looked at the frescoes - especially those of Giotto in the Capella Peruzzi.  Among those splendid tombs none are sosstriking [sic; so striking] and beautiful as that of Marsuppini by Desidero de Lettiguano.  Afterwards we went to the cloisters, and the little Pazzi chapel then to the Duomo, where we paused long before the beautiful gates in bronze by Luca della Robbia, at the entrance to the sacristy Nuova.               Page 131Then we crossed to the Baptistry, and then home.  In the afternoon Theodore and I took a long drive in the Cascine - and going quite to the end, we got out and walked through the quiet, deserted avenues.  Then home in time for dressing, and driving out to the Berenson’s who occupy a beautiful appartment on the Cascine square.  We met only Mrs. Baldwin, and Sir John Wood, a rather dull affair.  Came home in time to drive through the streets, and see the illumination in honour of the Royal Silver Wedding.April 23.              A morning in the Pitti with Mr. Berenson when we saw the pictures with larger, other eyes than our own.  In the afternoon rest, and Fielding and his sister Lady Clare to dinner.  Dr. Baldwin called.April 24.              To the Uffizi this morning - and a delightful two hours with the pictures - coming home more dead than alive, with fatigue.  Mr. Berenson stopped to lunch.  Howard, Theodore and I went out in the afternoon but could not do much, as a heavy shower came up.  Theodore went to see Lady Denbigh.  Nettie in the house with a bad throat.  Dr. Baldwin again.  He has been taking a general look over Theodore, who feels much better.  A mild epidemic of influenza prevails here.Page 132April 25th.              To the Belli-Arti this morning, where we met Lady Denbigh and Fielding and after an hour, spent principally with the Boticelli’s Mr. Berenson had told us that the three Archangels with the young Tobias, was not a Boticelli - so we looked at it critically, half resenting the disallusion.  It certainly lacks Boticelli’s colour but the spirit and action of the figures, seem certainly his.  In the afternoon Theodore took Lady Denbigh for the drive over the hills to the restored castle of the Englishman, Mr. Temple Leader - and Mrs. Davis, Howard and I went over the same road half an hour in advance of them.  The castle struck me as being very melodramatic - but the views were lovely.April 26th.              Theodore and I went this morning to see the collection at the Bordini Palace - a great many curious and delightful things - especially in marble of exquisite Italian decoration.  Theodore fancies immensely a piece of tapestry, which he thinks will go in the large space of the upper hall - but I am quite sure it is too large.  In the afternoon he took Lady Clare to drive, and Nettie being unfortunately still condemned to the house with her bad throat, Howard and I went to La Badia and San Lorenzo - and failed getting in to the beautiful Or San Michele.  Theodore went to dine with Lady Denbigh.  We declined but Howard Nettie and I went up in a closed carriage in the evening and paid a visit.  They are living in pension but having              Page 133a charming sitting room, radiant with flowers.  Lady Denbigh has a sweet, motherly air, that is very taking - Lady Herbert of Lea, a great friend of theirs was there - quite the English novel dowager - who made herself very agreeable.  Fielding had spoken of her as an “archbishop in petticoats”.  We all arranged to go to the Bardini palace tomorrow morning.  The night air is warm and delicious from the rain of today.April 27.              To the Bardini this morning - Lady Herbert came to go with us.  She bemoaned all the time the things she saw that had once belonged to churches and convents - and I am sure she found some of Theodore’s remarks quite horrifying.  Theodore took the tapestry.  Came home in the rain.  In the afternoon Theodore, Howard and I drove to the Cascine  - they got out to walk, while I drove round and round.  Everything dripping with moisture, and the shaded avenues fairly black so dark was the afternoon.  A thousand sweet scents in the air - we asked the Bronsons to dine tonight, but Mrs. B.  had a bad cold and could not come.April 28.              Howard and I went to the Opera del Duomo - and then did a little shopping.  It rained all day.  In the afternoon we went to tea at Mrs. Bronsons, taking Mr. Fielding with us.  It poured with rain while we were there - met two or three pleasant people.  Fielding and Page 134Lady Clare came to dinner - and Dr. Baldwin came in to say goodbye.April 30.  4th Sunday after Easter.       Venice.  Grand Hotel.              After a hurried morning yesterday, spent in seeing as much as we could of beloved Florence, we left at 2:30 - reaching here at 10 P.M.  The ride was charming, in the midst of so much luxurious spring vegetation.  The vineyards so pretty, with the vines suspended from tree to tree - the young leaves well grown, making garlands from one end to the other.  The entrance to Venice most opportune, on a cloudless night with a full moon - over which Nettie and Howard were in raptures.  We have big rooms on the 3d floor of this big house - Nettie and I together occupy one vast appartment - our little beds miles apart - and our balcony overhangs the Grand Canal.  This morning we went of course immediately to the Piazza San Marco - and then to the church - and afterwards along the Grand Canal - and again in the afternoon we went roaming in gondolas, in that delightful fashion common to Venice.  The first time I saw Venice it was wrapped in snow, the next, it was drenched in rain.  Now it is quite perfect - a bright sun by day, and a radiant moon by night.  The little bits of garden that show over the walls or through open portals, or great iron gates, make such perfect little touches.May 1st.              We all went down to the Piazza San Marco this morning, and wandered Page 135about, before we went into the church.  A magnificent funeral cortège appeared at the further end of the square; and the rich robes of the priests, the banner and canopies, the array of candles, the brilliant colours, made it like some of the old paintings one sees of the piazza.  It made a great spectacle too in the church, and especially from the galleries, where we went.  Mrs. Davis and Howard grew tired and went away - while Theodore, Nettie and I lingered over every detail - fairly caressing some of those mellow and time worn ornamental surfaces.  There have been many restorations - chiefly in the pavement - which look questionable - however necessary they might have been.  Their exact level and accurate outlines seem so inartistic, in comparison with the rich old marbles and irregular surfaces.  The strange undulating surface of the pavement with its beautiful Alexandrian work is always such a delightful feature.  We then went to the church of San Salvatore, where is an Annunciation by Titian painted in his 89th year - angels and clouds above, the Madonna with a look of glad surprise, and the Angel of Annunciation to the left, with the rush of descent still in his bearing - a grand thing - but little light to see it by.  From there we went to S.  Giovanni Crisostomo, where is a great picture of Giovanni Bellini of S.S.  Jerome, Cristopher and Augustine finished in 1513, in his 87th year, it had all Bellini’s beauty of colour, and a most sweet religious sentiment.  In the same church is a painting above the high altar of Sebastian del Piombo of SS Crisostom, John, Augustine, Liberali, Catherine, Agnes and Magdalen.  The faces of the women and the colouring fine - painted under the influence of Giorgione.  Page 136In the afternoon, Nettie and I went to the S. Zacharia, a church not far from the Riva dei Schiavoni - with a beautiful renaissance façade, and a madonna enthroned with four saints by Giovanni Bellini - and the nativity of John the Baptist by Tintoretto over the door of the sacristy.  The charm of going about Venice, threading one’s way through one little canal after another, with charms and surprises at every turn - then, perhaps stopping at a little flight of steps, as we did at S.  Zaccaria, walking through an arch, or a narrow calle or alley, into a quiet little campo, is truly enchanting.  But it takes time to get about in this way, and after we had gone to S. Maria Formosa to see Palma Vecchio’s magnificent Barbara, it was time to come home.  May 2d.              Theodore, Nettie and I put in the whole morning at the Academia, and came home to lunch in a limp condition.  Mr. Berenson had marked our books for us, telling us what was most worth seeing, which was a great boon, as our time is so short.  We first looked at a Madonna and child by Giov.  Bellini - and another Madonna with St. Catherine and a Magdalen; remarkable for the beauty in the faces of the women.  And still another Madonna with S.S.  Paul and George - and another Madonna enthroned with SS.  Francis, Job, John, Sebastian, Dominic and Louis, with 3 angels on the steps of the throne, playing on instruments - a lovely composition - Then, at some pictures by Cima da Conegliano, an artist about whom I was wofully ignorant - a Madonna with John the Baptist, and St. Paul - another Madonna with Page 137saints - and the angel Raphael with Tobias between the Baptist and St. Nicholas.  An exquisite painting of the Madonna and Saints by Boccacino da Cremona.  Naval battle with saints in the clouds and a Madonna and Saints by Paola Veronese.  The Presenation in the temple by Titian, a gorgeous mass of lovely color - his St. John in the Wilderness - his Entombment, painted in his 99th year it is said, and which indeed he left unfinished - and his wonderful assumption, which seems to me a far greater work than Raphael’s Transfiguration.  Fishermen presenting the Doge with the ring received from St. Mark, by Paris Bordone.  Banquet of Dives [sic; Divas] - Massacre of the Innocents, Solomon’s Judgement, by Bonifacio.  Madonna and child and four senators - Death of Abel - Two Senators and St. Mark releasing a condemned slave, by Tintoretto.  Cure of a Lunatic, with the Rialto bridge in the background - colour- perspective - architectural effects, and quaint detail.  Presentation in the Temple - and the nine scenes from the fascinating legend of St. Ursula, painted for the school of that name in Venice, charmingly quaint and interesting by Carpaccio.  Peter enthroned with other saints and the Assumption by Ralma Vecchio.  The St. George of A.  Mantegna, a small picture and very exquisite.  Five delightful little cabinet pictures, Allegories, by Giov.  Bellini - and the very interesting large picture of Gentile Bellini’s.  The finding of a portion of the true Cross - and The Procession in the Piazza of St. Marks - from its minute detail, it shows the changes which have taken place since 1496, when the picture was painted.  In the afternoon we went to the Church of the Madonna del Orto, where is a picture Page 138of St. John the Baptist, with St. Peter, Mark, Jerome and Paul by Cima da Conegliano - and Tintoretto’s Last Judgement, and Adoration of the Golden Calf, and Presentation in the Temple.  Then we went to S.  Maria dei Miracoli, a beautiful, small, early Renaissance church, with fine marbles and good decorations, where the most interesting thing was the old Sacristan who was so in love with his church and all his things, and so eager to show us the few little treasures it possessed, that he took us into the damp, dark little sacristy, and pulled out various drawers, to show us some poor and much worn ceremonial vestments.  I wondered what he would have said to the beautiful one hidden away in my trunk!  Nettie and I then went to S.  Giovanni in Bragora, where is a beautiful Baptism of Christ by Cima da Conegliano lovely light - colour - water - distance.  Two Saints by the same - and a Resurrection by L.  Vivarini - very fine - two upturned faces of angels.  Then we went to that little gem of a church, S.  Giorgio degli Schiavoni, a small renaissance church, with the well known pictures of Vittoria Carpaccio of the legends of St. George and St. Jerome - about which Ruskin has written such pleasant nonsense in his “Shrine of the Slaves”.  These pictures have all Carpaccio’s soft colour, and good painting, and crude conceits.  And the little square church, hardly larger than an ordinary sitting room, wainscoted with dark wood to the level on the narrow pictures, with the dark, low, ribbed ceiling, the beams gilded - and the two broad windows with their red curtains, with the sun shining brightly in, made such a cheerful interior, that we said we felt like having afternoon tea there, and bringing our work! Page 139and books.  Up the short flight of stairs into the second church or oratory, where the ceiling was still lower, and painted by Palma Vecchio and there were more low windows, with the sun streaming brightly in, the effect was even more domestic.May 3rd.              We said so much about the little S.  Giorgio Church when we went home, that Theodore was moved to go himself and he and I and Annie went this morning, and I was even more charmed.  Afterwards Theodore, Nettie and I went to S. Maria della Salute and saw in the sacristy, and saw Titian’s St. Mark and four Saints - and his Cain and Abel, Abraham and Isaac, David and Goliath.  The day was cloudy, and the light very bad.  Tolerable light on Tintoretto’s splendid Marriage of Cana.  Then we went into the Seminaris Patriarcale, and saw a small collection of pictures - among them Giogioni’s  Apollo and Daphne.  The building was interesting.May 4th.              Theodore, Nettie and I went on a delightful little excursion this afternoon.  Mr. Berenson had given Theodore a card of introduction to a Count Nardi - living at Mira, some distance from Venice - who had some good pictures, one of which he thought Theodore could buy.  We took an interpreter, as we had been told none of these people could speak French or English.  We had an early lunch, and got into a clean little steamer that carried us in half an hour to Fusana, where we took Page 140a little steam train, several miles to Mira.  We found the house but a short distance from the station.  Such extraordinary little monstrosities ornamented each side of the short avenue leading to the house, standing on pedestals two feet high, themselves hardly higher, short, misshapen grotesques of men and women, once evidently highly coloured.  The Count Nardi, was not at home, but we were asked in by a nice old crone - and found most of the house empty, and at our service.  There were quantities of pictures in the broad hall, that led straight through the house, above and below - one or two bearing the name Tiziano, and other talismanic names.  But the special picture we wanted to see was in the bedroom of a guest who was taking his siesta - and the old servant who talked loud enough at other times, lowered her voice so respectfully when she spoke of it, that we knew him to be an honoured guest, and not to be disturbed for curious Americans - and as the picture was valued at a fabulous price, by its owner, we were not desolated but gave a franc to the old woman, and came away.  Outside the gate we found the little carriage and its good natured looking driver, whom we had declined at the railway station, patiently waiting for his prey, and having three hours or more on our hands before we could take the train back to Venice, decided that we would drive on to Dolo.  The afternoon was quite perfect, warm and bright - the whole country fresh from last nights rain, in perfect spring beauty - the larks were singing - fields bright with flowers - the poppies showing their brilliant heads among the corn - the ditches by the roadside full of water lilies, and tall yellow irises - and the smooth level little Page 141road led along the bank of the little river Brenta which is really a canal, and past country houses on either side of the river, more or less grand, with beautiful shrubberies and quaint Italian gardens - and one succeeded another like pictures in a dream, until we came to the great walls of an immense park, which we were told was a Royal park or palace, once the property of the Pisani family - now a National Museum.  It is called Stra.  We were told we could go in, and we drove through the great gateway, and get out of the carriage at the grand portal, where if it had not been for the guard, and an old paralytic sitting in an easy chair, we might have supposed we had reached the Enchanted palace.  We saw no one else - and up the very grand staircase we went, and through room after room - reception rooms - bedrooms - great ball rooms and salons and stately corridors - all deserted, but ready, until I half expected to come upon the Sleeping Beauty.  Rooms once occupied by Victor Emmanuel, in one of which he signed the armistice between Italy and Austria.  Others in which the great Napoleon lived - his bedroom quite magnificent - the big bed all gold and white satin with a big N at the top - even the mattresses covered with rich white silk.  From every window, lovely glimpses of the grounds and trees, down to which we afterwards went, and walked through one or two of the stately avenues, and took a peep into the ornamental gardens, which had vanishing lines of great orange trees in huge ornamental pots - and geometrical bed of flowers - and stretches of glass - and miles of walled fruits.  The part itself seemed  a paradise, with its stretches of wide lawns and stately trees.  Then feeling hungry, we drove into the quaint little Page 142town, and into the courtyard of a clean little Osteria, and entered the principal room, low and long, with one end devoted to the kitchen, with its simple stone range and its bright array of copper pans and pots.  Over the little fire burning at the end of a large bunch of faggots a woman was roasting coffee in a simple and effective way.  A large iron ball with a long handle, which she twirled constantly.  We had an excellent colazione, bread, cheese, butter and a delicious native wine, all for 2 and a half francs.  While we were eating it, three men came in and ordered supper - and we saw Father, Mother and daughter cooking it.  The walls of the room were decorated with coloured prints - and a shrine before which burned a lamp - and curious little mottoes, framed and hung about, some of which I copied.  Vinci amico mio,				A fa credenzaMangia, beve e godi				E un erroraMa non piantar					Si perde el Denaro   Di chiadi					   E la ventore.       La luna senza sol       Non resplendi       Il vin senza dinar       Non si vendi.Afterwards we had a drive of 3 miles to the station, and were home again by 7 o’clock.  After dinner went to call on the Farrers.  Old Sir William looking aged and feeble - the two girls in deep black for their mother - very nice girls.  We are off tomorrow for Milan, early.  We have had perfect weather during our stay - and resplendent moonlight Page 143nights.  The grand Canal in front of the hotel has been filled every evening with gondolas - and much music.  We have been out on the water almost every evening - and what more delicious than to lie in a gondola with those perfect surroundings and listen to the dip of the oars in the silvered waters!Milan.  6 May.       Hotel Cavour.              Such a charming journey from Venice yesterday through the rich green country and past picturesque towns, arriving at this very pleasant and comfortable hotel, where, in our pleasant sitting room, we found a sumptuous lunch waiting for us.  Later we went out to see the Cathedral and to take a drive; but the really hot morning had changed - the clouds were big and black, and the wind blowing in such gusts that after leaving the Cathedral and trying a short drive, we gave it up and walked in the Arcade.  Mr. Fielding arrived from Florence in the evening.  This morning soon after breakfast we all, except Mrs. Davis, armed ourselves with our guide books and glasses, and went to the Brera, where we spent two hours looking only at the pictures Mr. Berenson had marked for us, and which formed the cream of the whole gallery.  We saw the Madonna enthroned with angels and saints by Bart.  Montagna - then Gentile Bellini’s Preaching of St. Mark at Alexandria.  Piero della Francesca’s Madonna and Saints with Duke Federigo Montefeltro.  C.Crivelli’s Christ on the Cross - Madonna and Saints - Madonna and Child - the latter most charming in its Pgae 144beautiful coloring and quaint accessories - Giov.  Bellini’s Madonna - the Madonna with the Greek inscription - and a Pieta - the last most tender and impassioned - the Madonna holding the Christ in her arms, and pressing her face to his - you can feel the tender support of her arms, and the suffering sympathy of her glance, as she gazes into the pale face - the tones of the picture sad and subdued - the pale sky with flat lines of cloud.  Bonifazio, the Elder’s Finding of Moses in the Bulrushes - a lovely thing in colour and figures.  Paola Veronese’s SS. Anthony, Abbas, Cornelius and Cyprian.  Mantegna’s Pieta, the Madonna in a nimbus of angels heads.  Saints by Cima da Conagliano.  Three superb portraits by Lorenzo Lotto and the famous Sposalizio of Raphael - one of the sweetest and saintliest pictures in the world.              Then we went to the Museo Poldi-Pezzoli - the collection house, bric-a-brac, furniture, pictures in most charming taste, made up of most precious and valuable things, and given by the owner at his death to the town.  A sweet Boticelli - Christ and St. Francis by Crivelli.  Ecco Homo by A. Solario, and Flight into Egypt - and the exquisite portrait of a lady generally attributed to Piero della Francesca but which Mr. Berenson says is not his.  In the afternoon Nettie Howard and I, with Jones rushed off directly after luncheon to see the churches of S. Ambrosio, S. Maria presso S. Celso, at the last we saw a lovely Bergognone,  Madonna and Child, with St. John the Baptist - and a sweet Sassoferato.  Nettie taking Jones, then went to look for photographs, and to the roof of the Cathedral - while Theodore and I, Howard and Annie started in 2 carriages for the drive to Monza the Royal Park Page 145which was very beautiful after we reached it, but the drive to which was long, dull and commonplace - the cold wind driving the dust in our eyes and ears - we were glad enough to get indoors again.  We leave early tomorrow for Luserne.Lucerne.  8 May.       Hotel National.              Left Milan Sunday morning - and had a beautiful day crossing that wonderful St. Gotthard pass, until we got well on the other side, where we found clouds and mist - and Lucerne quite damp and wet from recent rain.  I have never before been to this hotel - and think it more delightful than the Schweizerhof - which I know so well.  It is just on the border of the Lake, and very quiet, and a most excellent house.  Our big sitting room and bed rooms look out on the Lake and we have had a fire both today and last evening.  We walked this morning to see the Great Lion of Thorwaldean - and to the old bridges - visited our friend the antiquarian Bossard - and after lunch Nettie, Howard and I poked about among the shops, they being quite new to the charms of carved wood ornaments, and other Swiss fantacies which become after a visit or two, so hateful.  Then we had an organ concert at the Cathedral and Nettie and I walked about that cheerful little burying ground.  All day the clouds have hung low, and the mists have obscured the mountains and the cold wind has blown.  We will spend tomorrow night at Basle, en route to Paris.Page 146Paris - 14 May.       Hotel Westminster.  Sunday after Ascension.              We left Lucerne on the afternoon of the 9th.  After breakfast that morning Theodore and Fielding went for a long tramp - the rest of us took 2 carriages and went first to my old haunt the “Drei Linden”, where I used to go and walk with Annie and Col. Frendenberg and the Collins - but now how changed! Ever since the last time we were there 5 years ago, with Charlie and Nellie Wilson it is very changed.  The pleasant climb up the steep meadows, and the walk along the edge of the hill, with the three great Lindens standing there.  These are now the only things to mark the spot - roads having been cut, lots laid off, and staring new villas built - so we turned away disgusted and went to drive through the lovely blossoming country.  The meadows all about Lucerne are filled with the most graceful trees - they are like well kept parks - the ground was brilliant with flowers and the quaint Swiss houses, with their gardens and Archives, delighted Nettie.  We got home just in time for lunch, and were off immediately after to the station - reached Basle after a lovely ride at 5 o’clock - and walked about awhile before dinner.  The Trois Rois where we stopped looked very familiar.  the next morning we left at 9 o’clock for Paris - that long ride seemed less tiresome than usual - we had a comfortable compartment, and the country was in such full spring beauty.  We went to the Chatham - but did not like our rooms, and came here, where we have a charming appartment quite to ourselves - and every thing most convenient and luxurious.  We plunged of course at once into the vortex of shopping, and it seems just              Page 147now as if we would never be able to extricate ourselves.  This morning was so fresh and warm, that Theodore proposed that Nettie, I and Mr. Fielding should drive with him to the Bois, and have lunch there - which we did after having spent an hour or so at the Louvre.  We drove to the Café du Pavillion, where we had a delicious lunch under the trees, with an Hungarian band playing near.  We afterwards drove about the park, which was filled with people and carriages hurrying to the Longchamps races.  There were too many people, in fact.  Yet it is always pleasant to see the natural naive way in which the french enjoy themselves - such numbers everywhere - sitting or lying about on the grass, or sitting in chairs - or walking.  Mothers, nurses, babies, fathers with newspapers and books - or playing games - all manners of simple innocent enjoyments.May 24.              We are quite ready to leave for London tomorrow.  Our fortnight here has been a very busy one - and out of it we have lost 4 working days - that is 2 Sundays and 2 fête days - and we have been on a rush all the time.  It has rained much of the time.  Last Saturday we went out to Fontainbleau returning on Monday morning.  It rained most of the time we were there - though we did manage a drive through the superb beech forests on Sunday morning.Page 148London.  28 May.  Trinity Sunday.       Albemarle Hotel.  Piccadilly.              We crossed last Thursday from Boulogne to Folkestone on a beautiful day - and arrived here at 7 P.M.  A comfortable hotel, though not as good as Longs or the Bristol.  The weather is good - too good for the welfare of the country - for everywhere the fields are drying up - and the crops looking very thin and starved.  This morning Nettie, Theodore and I went down to St. Pauls - but found a long ordination service going on, and after hearing a little most beautiful music, we came out, and walked about the streets coming upon a quaint little church, into which we went, and found a delightful service just beginning.  The church was that of St. Nicholas Cole - Abbey - a small square renaissance structure, with curious tablets and memorial stones upon the walls.  The choir screen was very good - and it was beautifully decorated with vines, red cannas, and pink and white cyclamens.  The organ was splendidly played, but was a little too big for the church - much beautiful music was sung - Gounod’s Messe, among other things - and the choir composed about a third of the congregation.May 29.              We went by appointment this morning to Westminster Abbey and met Mary Parsons, and Mr. and Mrs. Cheston, and Mrs. Messer, a cousin of Marys, and daughter of our old Bishop McIllvaine of Ohio.  I used to know her long, long ago as Naine McIllvaine.  She married an Englishman years ago, who was no good - with not even a good social position - Page 149she has been a widow for some years with 2 girls and a boy.  She is very familiar with the Abbey and all its dignitaries and acted as our guide.  We went before we came away into the Triforium - and we also saw the extraordinary wax effigies, which have not until lately been shown to the public.  Queen Elizabeth, Charles II, William III and Mary, Queen Anne, William Pitt, Earl of Chatham and Lord Wilson - remarkable things - clothed with the clothes worn in life, and were used in the funerals of those buried in the Abbey.  Coming away very late we saw the Prince of Wales and his suite going in gorgeous state carriages to hold a levee at St. James Palace.  In the afternoon we went to leave cards on the Lidderdales, Rathbones, and Miss Lüling.  It poured with rain all the time.June 1st.              Shopping and sightseeing are keeping us busy.  Last evening Theodore, Nettie and I went to the opera, and heard the new play Pagliacci, with which we were greatly disappointed.  I had never seen Convent [sic; Covent] Garden Opera House before, and in spite of all I had heard in its disfavor I was amazed at its ugliness, bareness and discomfort.  I spent one afternoon at the National Gallery - the most delightful gallery in the world - so many great masterpieces and no trash - the different rooms so well arranged, and comfortable seats about everywhere.  We spent our time in the two rooms devoted to Dutch art - and what a beautiful art it is! We have seen several of the attractive art stores - and this morning we went early to Christies Page 150to see the Baring sale of pictures - a great crowd - and the street thronged with carriages.June 3.              Theodore and I went this morning to William Morris’ place in Oxford St. to look at rugs and stuffs.  We found enchanting things of all kinds - a beautiful rug amongst them, which Theodore will take I think, for the dining room.  Last evening Gaspard Farrer dined with us.  Tomorrow, Theodore, Nettie and I are going down in the country to Hothorpe, the place of the de Traffords - Lady Agness de Trafford is Fieldings sister - and this afternoon we all went by invitation from Lord Denbigh to the House of Lords.  He was waiting for us at the entrance and most kindly and good naturedly took us about everywhere.  It was immensely interesting - as some skirmishing was going on, on the Irish question - it was thought that Lord Salisbury would speak - but he didn’t.  The Conservative benches were very full - but those of the Liberal Unionists were almost empty.  Lord Zetland, a conservative, opened the debate, and was followed by Earl Spencer on the other side, who made an awkward hesitating attempt for a weak cause.  We had to come away just after Lord Waterford began in a clear and forcible way to demolish Lord Spencer - I was sorry to come away, but we had to dine with the Lidderdales who live at Kensington.  Yesterday for the first time we met Lord Denbigh.  Lady Denbigh called soon after we arrived, and had written asking us to tea in the afternoon.  We found her quite charming, and Lord Denbigh very nice in his own way, but very Page 151different from Fielding.  Their house, 2 Cromwell Houses, is all in disorder and filled with work people.  They are awfully hard up, poor things, and this house as well as Newnham Paddox is for rent.  We stopped on the way with Fielding at the Brompton Oratory - and heard some beautiful music - the large church crowded with a very good looking congregation.Hothorpe Hall.  Theddingworth - Rugby.       June 4.  Sunday evening.              Mrs. Davis with Howard and Fielding went yesterday morning to see the trooping of the Queen’s colours - they represented it quite a spectacle.  Mr. and Lady Agnes de Trafford came to lunch, and at 4 o’clock, Nettie, Theodore and I met them at the Euston St. Station with Fielding, and we came out here, changing cars at Rugby, where we had time for a cup of tea.  We got out at Theddingworth - a pretty little spot, and found a waggonette and servants with a little pony cart for the luggage, waiting for us.  A short time along a lovely road with great trees and a thorn hedge, which Theodore and Fielding preferred walking, brought us to the gates, and another little drive to the house, comfortable and unpretentious, with grass terraces and chapel and conservatory, exquisite views over the park with it elms and oaks - we had big rooms, all chintz and comfort - and such charming views from the windows, the park lying in the evening light, the image of quiet peaceful beauty.  A handsome dinner - flowers and gold service in a big dining room and music, and some rather slow conversa             Page 152tion in the evening - and at 11 o’clock Nettie and I gladly took our candle sticks and came up to our rooms; Theodore, Fielding and Mr. de Trafford at a game of billiards.  This morning I could hardly dress myself for looking out of the windows, at the sheep lying in the shade of the trees, and the cattle in their paddocks browsing on the green green grass.  After a delicious, substantial English breakfast, Lady Agnes took me to the chapel, built by Mr. de Trafford to the memory of a brother, and presently Mr. de Trafford and Fielding came in.  The chapel was small - in the Romanesque style - in excellent taste, and all the details well executed, the stained glass especially good in design and colour - the altar very good, and the Confessional richly carved.   These three young people took such pleasure in it, and showed such reverence.  They made many excuses then, and went off to mass at the neighboring estate of Bosworths - and Theodore and I roamed about gazing at the scenery - and the great stretches of park lands - such superb trees - such softness and richness.  Then Nettie joined us and I took them into the chapel, and then we walked down through the park as Mr. de Trafford had suggested, and crossed the little river, and out through the lodge gates into the public road, down to the village, where we found a typical English church and churchyard - gray with age and covered with ivy.  We found an interesting interior - part of the church belonging to the Norman period - with quaint old font, and inlaid pulpit.  The service had begun, and including ourselves there must have been 20 in the congregation.  I should have liked staying after service and looking about, but the church was very cold and Page 153damp and Theodore complaining of the chill, we contented ourselves with walking about the churchyard, and back to the Hall through the lanes in the warm still air, with the bees humming and the birds singing - Nettie was so charmed with the village and the cottages with their thatched roofs and bright flowers and their little front gardens and they are charming.  The clouds were so threatening we hurried - but the storm did not burst until after luncheon when we were out seeing the stables - and we had to wait sometime there, as it hailed smartly - and left the air beautifully clear and cool.  In the evening Nettie sang for us, and Fielding played, and I am writing my book up to date, writing very late.  We said goodbye as well as goodnight to Mr. de Trafford as he goes away early in the morning to a cricket match.  He is a great cricketer - and hunter.  He has 7 hunters in loose boxes in his stables.  He is the 2d son of Sir Humphrey de Trafford of Trafford Hall near Manchester - who gave him this estate of a 1000 acres 10 years ago, and he has lived here since and last autumn married Lady Agnes Fielding.  They seem most frankly in love with each other and before their marriage, he built a sitting room with bedroom above for her - the sitting room with their initials turned in the woodwork.  We leave tomorrow morning - going over to Newnham Paddox for lunch.London.  6 June.              We left Hothorpe yesterday soon after breakfast, Lady Agnes and Mr. Fielding with us, in a waggonette with a pair of fine horses, and a big hamper, for a drive of 13 miles to Newnham Paddox, the Denbigh Page 154estate.  The scenery was delicious the tall hedges gay with dog roses like our wild roses, but taller and less compact in manner of growth.  When we entered the park at Newnham, it was enchanting - splendid trees everywhere - the gates are quite magnificent and fine specimens of iron work - the house an enormous pile of brick with stone facings and a mansard roof - very ugly - a large chapel at one end, and what had been magnificent gardens on one side - terraced and geometrical with stretches of splendid shrubberies, the rhododendrons just off their prime.  We entered the first floor with big dining room and library, really 3 rooms in one, the library with deep embrasured windows - bed rooms, reception rooms and billiard room, all full of beautiful and interesting things - and then to the next floor, where were the state dining room and drawing room with walls covered with family portraits and pictures - those in the drawing room mostly full length and built into the walls! There were 2 state bed rooms once occupied by Queen Adelaid with superb furniture and hangings in rose coloured brocade - ante rooms and sitting rooms, until one’s head was turned.  The family portraits are interesting.  The first Countess of Denbigh created in 1622 was Susan Villiers, sister of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham - full length portrait of both of them by Van Dyke - and of the Duke of Hamilton and many others with strange histories, which Lady Agnes and Fielding rattled off to us most amusingly.  There was a portrait of King James presented by himself - and a miniature of William 3d painted by the then Countess of Denbigh.  The chapel was beautiful - quite a church - and there is a resident priest with a house in the grounds - and a Page 155fine organ.  Beautiful fresh flowers everywhere about - the church serves for the parish church - there is an entrance from the house, and from the second floor, a large balcony opens on the church.  After we had seen the house, lunch was served in one of the down stairs rooms half sitting room and half library, and a very good one it was - a kind of a picnic - and we were very merry - though the sister and brother must have felt it very sad - their home no longer - the changed and dismantled house - for no one lives there now, and they hope to let it.  Word had been sent to the housekeeper yesterday, that we would be there to lunch - the few servants about, so glad to see the members of the family.  The late Earl though a lovely character was a fanatic - and parted with everything he could, to build a church and monastery in Wales, where he now lies buried.  The church has a rather strange history.  It was begun by the Earl and his first wife who were protestants.  She soon died - he entered the Roman communion, and the church was diverted from protestant to Roman and finished as such.  After luncheon we went again into the grounds - and into the garden, which is huge - a high wall about it, and the gardeners cottage within the walls.  There was a great deal of glass - the grapery magnificent - but everything showed neglect and want of expenditure.  But how lovely the grounds were - especially near the river - what superb trees!  We went back to the house through what is called the grass avenue, a long beautiful avenue of beeches with a grass road between.  In one of the rooms we saw drawings of Newnham in all its stages.  It began very well and was very good looking, then it was enlarged and Page 156changed to disadvantage - then the late Earl built the present ugly thing around the old house.  A carriage arrived from Rugby early in the afternoon to take us to the station, and Theodore, Nettie and I said goodbye to Lady Agnes and Fielding who waved their adieux as long as we could see them - then we had a pleasant drive through Lutterworth to Rugby, took the train for London - and are once more in smoke and turmoil - and a wretched exchange it is for the lovely sylvan scenes we left behind us!7 June.              Theodore and Nettie have gone tonight to hear Mr. and Mrs. Kendal in a “Scrap of Paper”.  This morning I went with Theodore to Christie’s to see pictures and a lot of lovely things - we intended to stay but a moment, but it was nearer 2 hours.  Among them are two lovely little portraits of a prince and princess by P. Mignard, and 2 pictures of Aart Van der Neer, a river scene, and a Dutch Town on a River - and a lovely example of A. Van der Velder “A Calm”.  Theodore intends bidding for these at the auction on the 10th.  This afternoon Annie, Nettie, Howard and I went out to St. John’s Wood to have tea with Mrs. Messer - a dismal, commonplace little house, and two very commonplace daughters - a very clever son.June 8.              This morning with Theodore and Fielding to the Dowdeswell Gallery to see some early English paintings.  This afternoon Theodore Page 157Nettie and I drove out to the Dulwich Gallery, to see the fine collection of Cuyps they have there - as we drove away from the hotel, met Eddie Lidderdale, and took him along.  This evening Mr Fielding dined with us and we went to the Savoy theatre to hear the play of “Jane Annie”, written by Barrie and Conan Doyle, the music by Ernest Ford - and excessively weak, boring thing - utter bosh - house practically empty.  We came home in hansoms.  It is wonderful to see the jam and crush of the streets of London at night!June 9.              Just home from a pleasant dinner in the bachelor appartments of the Farrar brothers - our whole pilgrimage went - and they had their married sister Mrs. Parker down from the country.  A delightful fashion for 3 brothers to live in.  The 3 dining room windows open on St. James Park and the drawing room windows nearly opposite the Carlton Club.  A rather pleasant man by the name of Boyle took me in - he is cousin to the writer on gardening E.V.B., a woman.  The other evening when we were dining at the Lidderdales, I went in with a Mr. Arbuthnot, who proved very agreeable - and some one happening to speak of John Inglesant, said that he knew Shorthouse - a small insignificant looking man, a screw maker by trade - and when Arbuthnot once said to him, having been much in Italy, that he, Shorthouse must know Italy and the Italians well, said he had never been there - that he knew of it, he got from the journals of his mother - who had travelled a good deal, and kept a faithful record of all she saw and heard - that after her Page 158death these journals coming into his possession he began to write this story - that his MSS. lay for years in his desk, until one day his wife begged to read it, and then urged him to publish it!June 10.              Quite alone tonight; Annie, Nettie and Howard having gone to Oxford today to stay over Sunday, and take in Kenilworth and Stratford and Theodore having gone to Dorking to spend Sunday with the Rathbones - I had a very cordial note from Mrs. Rathbone, asking me to come too, but I thought it best to decline.  This morning about 10 o’clock, Mr. Berenson appeared, and Theodore, M. [sic; N.] and I went off to the French Gallery to see a beautiful portrait of a Lady of Ferdinand Bol, which Theodore has just bought.  Fielding and Mr. Berenson to lunch, and they and Theodore left immediately after for the auction at Christie’s.  A great labor parade took place this afternoon.  It came up St. James St. turned into Piccadilly on its way to Hyde Park.  It began at 4:50 and about 7:50 the rear end turned the corner.June 11.  2d Sunday after Trinity.              Alone all day - and not out of the house - resting and writing.  Jones just home after a visit of a few days to his people - bringing a new parlor-maid.  He has just shown me a letter he received from Mohammed Salah from Cairo - he says the Golinischeffs had just arrived from up the river.  It must have been warm enough by that time - though the papers report the cotton crop an almost entire failure in Egypt Page 159because of the continued cold weather.June 12.              I waited a long time for Theodore’s return from Dorking this A.M. finally Mr. Berenson came in - and after awhile Theodore appeared and we went off immediately to Agnews to see some pictures.  In the afternoon Mr. Farrer came according to appointment and went with us to St. James Mall to hear Grossmith in a humourous recitation of how he discovered America!  very amusing - but a little tiresome, the hall frightfully warm and close.June 13.              My birthday!  And I am 56 years old!  Well, I cannot believe it! Mr. Farrer came in soon after breakfast to say goodbye, as he is off for a yachting tour - and then came his brother, afterwards the interesting, travelled, rather invalid brother - then Mr. Berenson and Nettie and I went off with him to the National Gallery to the early Italian and Tuscan rooms - and oh! what delightful treasures of art we saw!  Fra Fillipo Lippi’s Madonna and Child - and his beautiful Annunciation painted for Cosimo de Medici, with his crest.  S.S. John the Baptist, Francis, Lawrence, Cosmos, Damianus, Anthony and Peter the Martyr - also painted for Cosimo.  Then Botticelli’s Adoration of the Magi, attributed to Filippino Lippi, son of Fillipo - Botticelli’s Mars and Venus - his lovely Nativity, with the dance of the angels among the clouds, and the angels embracing the saints below.  Pollajuola’s Page 160St. Sebastian, with wide landscape of the Val D’Arno.  The death of Procris by Piero di Cosmio.  Fra Angelico’s large and important picture, Christ with the banner of the Resurrection, with crowd of saints and Martyrs.  Giov. Bellini’s Christ in Gethsemane.  The warrior adoring the infant Jesus, attributed to Bellini, but painted by Cactena.  A delicious picture of St. Jerome, reading, by Marco Basaite.  Portrait of a man, by Andrea del Sarto - and the several splendid pictures by Moroni.  Before these we sat and talked, and Mr. Berenson was very instructive and interesting.  After two hours we came away well tired out.  After lunch Theodore and I went shopping, came home at 5 o’clock for tea, and out again for a drive to the Park, where we spent some time walking about on the grass, among the superb oaks and beeches - the grass almost dead from the protracted drought.  Theodore has gone tonight to dine at the Lidderdales to meet Mr. Bush and Blaird who are just arrived - they were here this morning, but I was out.  The brought good news of Toby and home.June 14.              Theodore went out this morning with Mr. Rathbone, Nettie and Mr. Berenson to the National Gallery, and Howard went with me to several shops, then we drove out to the Row to see the riding, and sat under the big trees for an hour, then home to luncheon, Mr. Buk, Fielding and Berenson lunching with us.  Nettie and Mr. Fielding went off then to see the restored church of St. Bartholomew, and St. Saviours in Surry [sic; Surrey], and for a lark on the tops of omnibuses, and came home late, in great glee, Page 161dined early, and were off to the theatre.  I went about after lunch, doing a lot of things, and then joined Theodore and Mr. Berenson at the National Gallery - then home for tea and muffins.  Theodore, Annie, and I went to dine at the Amphitryon Club with Mr. Rathbone, and then to the Empire Theatre, where we had a box.  It is a kind of glorified Café Chantant, and was hideously uninteresting - only redeemed by some trained French poodles, who did wonderful things.June 15.              Mr Henry Farrar came this morning according to appointment, and went with me and Mr. Berenson to the National Gallery, to see the Italian pictures again, Mr. Farrar knowing Italian art very well, and being very fond of it, we had a charming morning.  We pent a long time over the Memlings, this gallery possessing the largest and finest collection in the world.  Mr Berenson came to lunch, Fielding also - and he and Theodore spent the afternoon together.  I went off to do a little shopping - came home at 5 o’clock - for a cup of tea - and found them still talking.  Then Theodore went off to call on Lord and Lady Denbigh - Nettie and Mr. Berenson came home after a delightful afternoon at the Abbey.  It is our last evening in London - and we are in the last throes of packing, at which Jones has been busy all day.S.S. Furst Bismark.       Tuesday, June 20th.             We got away from London early Friday morning - Mr. Fielding Page 161was at the station to see us off.  Reached Southampton at 11 o’clock and embarked immediately on the tender.  The day was excessively hot, and we lay waiting for the Bismarck until 3 o’clock.  Dreadful hours they were - when she at last came in, slowing up near us, she dropped her anchor, which getting beyond control for some reason, rushed out with fearful force and was lost.  It created a great stir, and knocked the deck about the Capstain very much out of order.  We were soon off - found our old deck rooms ready for us.  We have about 90 first class passengers - a full 2d class - and a large 3d class as they take no more steerage passengers.  I have never seen so vulgar and noisy a crowd of people.  The weather has been good and favorable - have made splendid runs - and if we meet with no detention, should be in New York by Thursday night, or Friday morning.
