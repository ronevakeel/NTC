After you bade us goodbye that day, which seems so long ago, we ret~ to our sumptuous stateroom to find it filling up with b"skets of fro boxes of fl~wers, letters, telegrams and books from many of those to whom we have endeared ourselves. One wondrous basket Was from Nelso and Wallace, and n box of chrysanthemums us big as cabbages with see a yard long was from We were an hour late i sailiD~. and didn't start till twelve.

Dear Cousin Tn remarks at intervAls what n fine fellow you ore, and
painst1Jkin~ly explains nguin and oguin ho'" it happened th:.t he did not
recognize you. He is perfectly devotee to Doris and I am tickled :.lmost
to death. He said the other day that with us two in Egypt he knew he'd
have a charming time. "I've sometimes had such dreadful people", he
cJdded!
I do so hope you can find time to go to see Kimmy. Please do if you possibly can, Dearest. I'm so afraid the memory of his family mAy grow dim if he doesn't see any of us for six months, and I really could not bear that.
Did Doris tell you of our wonderful presents from Mrs. Eells? For D. a check for 250 france to buy something for herself; and for me a beautiful wooden box with lock and key, filled with the most delightful toilet articles, exquisite soaps, colognes, bath salts etc. etc.
Well, Beloved, goodbye for this time. I'm wondering when my postal from Gibraltar will reach you. My love to Jock and Wilson Foss. Endless, endless love to you and every blessing on your dear hend.
Your very own
