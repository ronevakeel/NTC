until considerably later. But, presum~bly, there will be bumpings

This steamer is very and most remarknbly steady; the service is excellent, filling and me courteous; and as for the Table you could stuff until you burst if : were so disposed. The minus have included everything the plain Arne) has been used to from infancy, as well as everything you never henrc
from "Spit-cake" to "Lobskans with dined cucumber."
After you bade us goodbye that day, which seems so long ago, we ret~ to our sumptuous stateroom to find it filling up with b"skets of fru boxes of fl~wers, letters, telegrams and books from many of those to whom we have endeared ourselves. One wondrous basket Was from Nelso and Wallace, and n box of chrysanthemums us big as cabbages with she a yard long was from We were in hour late i sailiD~. and didn't start till twelve.

but I doubt if even her fluent pen can give you more than a fRint id of the splendour, the grimness and the charm of that wonderful spot. We did so hanker for you, and Jones was the first to say it aloud! how much he wished you were theT~

"Not with me there, sir," said Jones. But he \\'ouldn't let us go. However the flashing lights of the town near the water and the soft radiance in ; moonlight of tier upon tier of dim, white, closely pRcked buildings J ing to the crest of the hill was R lonely spectacle from the deck of ship. Today the Mediterranean has been too choppy for perfect be~ut~ but we've had Sardinia with us most of the time with its rocky mount, ranges, fit home for hordes of bandits.

Dear Cousin l. remarks at interv~ls want n fine fellow you ore, find
painst1Jkin~ly explnins nguin find oguin ho'" it happened th:.t he did not
recognize you. He is perfectly devoted to Doris find I am tickled :.lmost
to death. He said the other day that with us two in Egypt he knew he'd
have a charming time. "I've sometimes had such dreadful people", he
cJdded!
I do so hope you can find time to go to see Kimmy. Please do if you possibly can, Dearest. I'm so afraid the memory of his family may grow dim if he doesn't see any of us for six months, and I really could not bear that.
Did Doris tell you of our wonderful presents from Mrs. Eells? For D. a check for 250 france to buy something for herself; and for me a beautiful wooden box with lock and key, filled with the most delightful toilet articles, exquisite soaps, colognes, bath salts etc. etc.
Well, Beloved, goodbye for this time. I'm wondering when my postal from Gibraltar will reach you. My love to Jock and Wilson Foss. Endless, endless love to you and every blessing on your dear hend.
Your very own
